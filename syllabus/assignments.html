<h2 id="projects"><a class="header" href="#projects">Projects</a></h2>
<p>I will assign several projects during the semester, and I've created a separate
website covering the details of these projects. Each project falls into one of
the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Guided Project</strong> provides step-by-step instructions for writing a program.
These steps won't tell you exactly what to code, but they break the program
into a series of smaller problems that you can solve one at a time.</li>
<li>An <strong>Expanded Project</strong> builds on previous Guided Projects to create a more
complete program. It is significantly more complex than a Guided Project, and
you will not be given step-by-step directions for completing each task. You
also have the option to propose an alternative version of the assignment.</li>
<li>A <strong>Self-Directed Project</strong> requires you to design your own program and submit
a proposal describing it. Self-Directed Projects are optional and can be used
to replace any of the other projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-submission"><a class="header" href="#project-submission">Project Submission</a></h2>
<p>All projects must be submitted on Blackboard, and most projects must pass a set
of tests to be considered complete. To make it easier for me to check new
submissions frequently, I require projects to be zipped in a particular format.
I will provide a program that checks whether your project passes these tests and
then zips your project in the correct format.</p>
<p>If a project submission is improperly zipped, is missing any tasks/deliverables,
or does not pass the required test cases, then that submission will be marked as
incomplete. You may resubmit the project as long as you follow the restrictions
in the deadlines section below.</p>
<h2 id="deadlines"><a class="header" href="#deadlines">Deadlines</a></h2>
<p>I don't like assigning deadlines for assignments unless there is a compelling
reason that I need your work by a particular time or need to otherwise limit
submissions. If I do set a deadline or other restriction, then I will explain
why.</p>
<p>The following restrictions apply to project submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are allowed to submit Guided Project assignments as often as you like
until 11:59 PM ET on Thursday, December 12th.</li>
<li>You can submit up to one proposal for a Self-Directed Project or an
alternative Expanded Project every week.</li>
<li>You can submit up to one Self-Directed Project or Expanded Project (I'll refer
to these as the open-ended projects) each week.</li>
<li>If a project requires me to approve a proposal, then you cannot submit that
project until the week after you submit the proposal.</li>
<li>The cutoff for weekly proposal/project submissions is
11:59 PM ET on Sunday. If you submit after this time, then it
will count as your submission for the following week.</li>
<li>The last weekly proposal deadline is
11:59 PM ET on Sunday, December 1st.</li>
<li>The last weekly project deadline is
11:59 PM ET on Thursday, December 12th.</li>
<li>There is a small window in which I will accept late work: if you submit an
assignment after the deadline but before I download the submissions from
Blackboard, then I will count your submission as on time. I usually download
submissions in the morning or early afternoon the day after the deadline and
then close the link on Blackboard, but <strong>I do not make any guarantees for work
submitted after a deadline. An open Blackboard link after the deadline does
not mean your submission will be accepted, and I may download submissions at
any time once the deadline has passed. Submitting after the deadline is always
a gamble, and I do not recommend it.</strong> I will otherwise not accept any late
submissions and will strictly enforce all deadlines. The deadline for Guided
Projects and final weekly deadline for open-ended projects is your last
opportunity to submit work for this class.</li>
</ul>
<p>My reasons for these restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Guided Project assignments can be fully checked by my test program and a
couple of scripts, so they take little time for me to review. I leave myself a
week at the end of the semester to determine final grades, review projects one
last time, and resolve academic integrity cases.</li>
<li>I chose to go with weekly project/proposal submissions instead of
project-specific deadlines to keep the open-ended projects more flexible. The
limit of one per week ensures I don't get flooded with too many late in the
semester. I aim to review them within a week of the cut-off so you can have
timely feedback.</li>
<li>I give specific times and enforce deadlines strictly to ensure I handle
assignment submissions consistently and fairly. It doesn't matter how close
you are to a missed deadline or what excuse you offer. You either submit the
assignment on time or arrange for an extension (see below); otherwise, I will
not accept the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extensions-and-other-exceptions"><a class="header" href="#extensions-and-other-exceptions">Extensions and Other Exceptions</a></h2>
<p>In rare cases (such as medical or family emergencies), I will allow an extension
to a deadline or an exception to another restriction on submitting an
assignment. You can email me to ask for a such an exception if you believe one
is appropriate in your situation. Your email should include an explanation of
why you need the extension, a new proposed deadline (or other proposed change to
existing restrictions), and your current progress on the assignment. Be sure to
send me your code and any other material you've created for the assignment so
far.</p>
<p>I have some expectations if I am going to give an extension or make an exception
to a class policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've demonstrated that you read this policy by including <em>all</em> of the
information I just asked for.</li>
<li>If you're having trouble with the assignment, then you're taking steps to get
help. Usually this means seeing a tutor or going to office hours.</li>
<li>You are clearly making an effort to keep up with the class and not
procrastinating. If there is an ongoing problem affecting your work or
participation in the class and you want me to accommodate you, then you must
let me know early and keep me informed as that situation develops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions and other exceptions are given on a case-by-case basis. I will try to
be as fair as possible, but this comes down to my judgement and whether you've
been proactively communicating with me.</p>
<h2 id="advice"><a class="header" href="#advice">Advice</a></h2>
<p>If you struggle with deadlines or time management, then I'd like to offer some
advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start your work early. You have four to six assignments to complete depending
on your desired grade, and you probably won't be ready to start them for the
first few weeks of class. It's not a big workload if you spread it out, but it
will be overwhelming if you let it pile up towards the end of the semester.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlines in this class are not targets.</strong> If I give you a deadline, then
this is the latest that I'm willing to accept the assignment under most
circumstances. I expect you to finish and submit the assignment much earlier.
If you plan to submit something the night it's due, then there's a good chance
you'll miss that deadline. I can't stop you from taking this risk, but you
have to accept the consequences if it doesn't work out.</li>
<li>There are people you can talk to if you need help. Talk to someone when you
<em>start</em> having trouble; don't wait until you feel hopelessly stuck or
overwhelmed. And if you did wait until you were overwhelmed, that doesn't mean
it's too late to get help! That just means it's even more urgent that you ask
for help <em>now</em>, and that it may take more effort to catch up.
<ul>
<li>I'm available by email and during
<a href="./communication.html#office-hours">office hours</a>.</li>
<li>The Learning Commons employs peer tutors who can help you with this class.</li>
<li>Academic coaches can be reached by email and are available by appointment.
They may not be able to help you with your code, but they're great to talk
to if you have trouble with time management or adjusting to college.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep backups of your work in case you have a problem with your computer.
Google Drive and Dropbox both have free plans, and I believe you can use
OneDrive for free through your QU account. You can also download any work you
previously submitted on Blackboard.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-assignments"><a class="header" href="#other-assignments">Other Assignments</a></h2>
<p>There will be other assignments in addition to the projects. For example, I may
ask you to read a section of my notes, view a video, or complete a practice
activity. While I may not deduct points from your grade if you miss these
assignments, ignoring reading and practice assignments may result in you not
acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge to complete the major projects,
which means they can still <em>indirectly</em> affect your final grade. I try not to
assign work frivilously, and I expect you to complete assignments whether or not
I attach a grade to them.</p>
