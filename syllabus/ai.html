                        <h1 id="academic-integrity-ai-policy"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-ai-policy">Academic Integrity (AI) Policy</a></h1>
<p>Here is a link to Quinnipiac University's Academic Integrity (AI) policy:
<a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/academic-integrity-policy/">https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/academic-integrity-policy/</a>. This
policy applies to all courses at QU, and this part of the syllabus goes into
detail about how the AI policy works in our class. From this point forward I
will assume you are familiar with the school's AI policy.</p>
<h2 id="permission-to-share-and-discuss-work"><a class="header" href="#permission-to-share-and-discuss-work">Permission to Share and Discuss Work</a></h2>
<p>I consider it important that you can freely discuss assignments with other
students. Your peers can be an excellent source of help and feedback, and your
own insights and feedback can greatly help other students. I don't want the
school's or my AI policies to discourage you from talking to anyone else about
your work. Therefore, this section serves as my explicit written permission to
do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may share work you create for this class with anybody, including your
classmates, and publicly post this work online.</li>
<li>You may discuss assignments from this class with anybody. You may ask anybody
for help with these assignments and view their work if they are willing to
share it with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, you own all the work you do for this class, and that means you
decide what to do with it. However, I need to clarify that this permission does
not extend to the following actions, all of which directly violate the school's
AI policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not share work or post it publicly for the purpose of helping someone
else violate the school's AI policy. This includes if somebody asks you for
your work and informs you that they plan to copy it before you share the work
with them. See the section on &quot;Facilitation and Collusion&quot; in the school's AI
policy.</li>
<li>You may not copy your work from other people or from a large language model
(an &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; program). I'll cover this in more detail in a
later section.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not consider you responsible for anyone's misuse of material that you
shared in good faith. I will always take your word regarding how you intended or
expected your work to be used unless I have strong evidence that contradicts
you.</p>
<h2 id="what-counts-as-plagiarism"><a class="header" href="#what-counts-as-plagiarism">What Counts as Plagiarism?</a></h2>
<p>First and most important: <strong>in any situation where you have doubts or are unsure
whether an action would violate this policy, ask me!</strong> It's always okay to ask
whether you <em>can</em> do something.</p>
<p>This section exists for two reasons: to make it easier for someone who has
genuine questions to determine whether an action qualifies as cheating, and to
give me something to point to if somebody claims they didn't know their actions
qualified as cheating. Going through a series of flimsy excuses is one of the
most tedious parts of handling an AI violation, so I'd like to be thorough here
and save myself some trouble later.</p>
<p>This will focus on plagiarism on programming assignments. I'll use the phrase
&quot;<strong>other work</strong>&quot; to refer to any work that was created by somebody other than
you or by an LLM (such as ChatGPT). The following actions will nearly always
violate the AI policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying <strong>other work</strong> in whole or in part, whether by copying the file,
copying and pasting the file's contents, or viewing the file and retyping the
same information by hand. Modifying <strong>other work</strong> after copying it, whether
to disguise the copying or &quot;make it your own&quot; (an excuse I've heard
frequently) does not change the fact that it was copied. What matters is that
you copied work, not how you copied it or what you did before or after copying
it.</li>
<li>Paraphrasing <strong>other work</strong> in whole or in part. As far as I'm concerned, this
is the same as copying. In my experience, some paraphrasing is often used to
disguise that work was copied, and the claim that work was paraphrased is used
as an excuse to deny having copied work.</li>
<li>Using <strong>other work</strong> as a reference when creating your own work. This normally
results in copying or paraphrasing as described above, but I mention it
because it's another common excuse used to explain evidence of copying.</li>
<li>Doing your work under the direction of another person. It's okay to talk to
someone about your work while you're working, but it's not okay to let them
dictate the code to you. If you're mostly writing what someone else tells you
to write, then you are not doing your own work. Try talking to them about your
problem, taking some notes, and then fixing the problem on your own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions to the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use material that I intentionally provide you (such as my notes,
starter code, assignment descriptions, or examples from class) with or without
modification in your own work for this class. You don't need to document your
use of such material because it is expected and obvious from context.</li>
<li>If you want to copy or paraphrase from another source, then you can as long as
you do the following:
<ul>
<li>Discuss it with me first and get my permission to use the other work on the
assignment.</li>
<li>Clearly state which outside sources you used and provide a reliable link or
other means to access those sources.</li>
<li>Clearly show what was taken from the other source and what is your own
original work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Two general rules I use if someone appears to have plagiarized but claims they
did not:</p>
<ul>
<li>If large sections of your code are identical or nearly identical to existing
code, then it isn't your work. If you are writing your own code and following
the guidelines I provide in this policy, then you should always end up with
significantly different code on all but the simplest programs.</li>
<li>If you don't understand your code and cannot explain how it works, then it
isn't your work. You should not be using code that you don't understand, and
you are not going to accidentally write a working program that solves a
specific problem without some understanding of the code you're writing. If
your code doesn't appear to be something a student realistically would have
written and you cannot explain how it works, then I will not accept it for an
assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="retaking-this-class-and-self-plagiarism"><a class="header" href="#retaking-this-class-and-self-plagiarism">Retaking this Class and Self-Plagiarism</a></h3>
<p>If you are retaking this class, then I expect you to complete every assignment
from scratch without reusing any of your old work. I consider reusing work from
the last time you took this class equivalent to reusing work you completed for a
different class (&quot;double-dipping&quot; in QU's AI policy).</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-and-llms"><a class="header" href="#chatgpt-and-llms">ChatGPT and LLMs</a></h2>
<p>You're free to discuss assignments with LLMs such as ChatGPT, but I do not
recommend using them for this class. While we might colloquially refer to an LLM
as an &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; these tools are not intelligent and do not
understand the conversation they are having with you. They are complex
algorithms running on powerful hardware, and they are very good at one thing:
using their training data to produce text that looks like something a human
might write in the context of your conversation. LLMs are prone to hallucinating
(making up false information), and they do not know when they are hallucinating.
These tools are most useful in the hands of an expert who can critically
evaluate the information generated by an LLM. You are most likely not an expert
at this point.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, I treat material generated by an LLM the same as material
created by another person for the purpose of this AI policy. It is not your
work, and using this material in an assignment violates this policy.</p>
<p>If you are using ChatGPT for help with an assignment, then please save that
conversation so you can share it with me or the AI Office if your work is called
into question. This is an easy way to establish whether you used the tool
appropriately, and if you cannot or will not provide that evidence then I will
not give you the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<h2 id="consequences-for-ai-violations"><a class="header" href="#consequences-for-ai-violations">Consequences for AI Violations</a></h2>
<p>Consequences for AI violations are determined either by joint resolution, case
review, or a hearing. In a joint resolution, you and I must agree to any
proposed consequences, and in a case review or hearing I will still be consulted
about appropriate consequences. This section covers what I believe are
appropriate consequences <em>on a first offense</em> for most AI violations.</p>
<p>If you plagiarize, cheat, or otherwise violate the AI policy on an assignment,
then under no circumstances will I consider it appropriate to give you credit
for the assignment. This is <strong>not</strong> a punishment for cheating, it is simply
enforcing the requirements of the grading system. If you copied or cheated on
even a small portion of the assignment, <strong>then you did not complete the entire
assignment</strong>; you completed <em>some</em> of the assignment and then copied the
remaining work. To give any credit, full or partial, would be a reward for
cheating.</p>
<p>In addition to enforcing the normal penalty for incomplete work, I consider the
following consequences to be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you cheat on one assignment, then your final grade should be reduced by one
letter grade after accounting for the incomplete assignment. I will not allow
you to redo the assignment, but you may replace the assignment with a
Self-Directed Project if there is enough time remaining. If there isn't enough
time to complete a Self-Directed Project, then I will <strong>not</strong> give you an
extension.</li>
<li>If you cheat on multiple assignments, then you should receive a final grade of
F. Depending on the extent or nature of this cheating (for example, if you
cheat on more than two assignments), further penalties may be appropriate.</li>
</ul>
