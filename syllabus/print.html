<h2 id="description"><a class="header" href="#description">Description</a></h2>
<p>CSC110 is an introduction to programming using the Java programming language and
the Jshell REPL. The primary focus of this class is developing problem-solving
skills and a general knowledge of programming that will be useful to you in most
programming languages. While we will spend a lot of time learning about Java and
how to write good code, writing code isn't our ultimate goal. The most important
skill you can learn in this class is how to <em>think</em> like a programmer. Once
you've mastered that, writing code is surprisingly easy.</p>
<p>This syllabus also covers any sections of CSC110L that I am teaching this
semester. Policies specific to CSC110L are in the lab section of this syllabus.
If you are taking the lab with a different instructor, then refer to their lab
syllabus.</p>
<h2 id="objectives"><a class="header" href="#objectives">Objectives</a></h2>
<p>CSC110 and CSC110L share objectives. Upon successful completion of both courses,
students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss the challenges inherent in communicating with (programming) a
(non-reasoning) computer.</li>
<li>Break a complex problem down into smaller more manageable components.</li>
<li>Provide step-by-step instructions to solve small computational problems.</li>
<li>Using at least one programming language, write examples of and solve problems
in programs with the following basic programming constructs and tools:
<ul>
<li>Mathematical expressions</li>
<li>Conditional expressions</li>
<li>Simple iterative statements</li>
<li>Simple functions</li>
<li>Simple data structures, such as arrays, lists, and strings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discuss the importance of commenting and good code structure/style</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="syllabus-revisions"><a class="header" href="#syllabus-revisions">Syllabus Revisions</a></h1>
<p>There are a few reasons that I may update this syllabus:</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of students and I have agreed to change a policy during the first
week of class. Parts of this syllabus are negotiable, and I will mention these
during our first class.</li>
<li>A policy is not working as intended or a problem with the syllabus comes up
later in the semester. For example, if a project was due in the middle of the
semester and we had not covered the necessary topics before it was due.</li>
<li>I need to correct a mistake in the syllabus, such as a broken link or
inaccurate information about an assignment or policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the syllabus needs to be revised, then any changes will be noted here. I will
also keep older versions of the syllabus available on Blackboard so that there
is a clear record of all changes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="communication-and-office-hours"><a class="header" href="#communication-and-office-hours">Communication and Office Hours</a></h1>
<h2 id="office-hours"><a class="header" href="#office-hours">Office Hours</a></h2>
<p>I am a part-time faculty member and do not have an office on campus. However, I
can meet in person from 3:15 to 4:30 PM ET. Our classroom should be free until
3:45, and there is a space for part-time faculty on the second floor of the CCE
building that we can use after 3:45. You can stay after class if you're in the
2:00-3:15 section or come back at 3:15 if you're in the 12:30-1:45 section.</p>
<p>I may end office hours early if all students leave before 4:30. Please send me
an email ahead of time if you plan to arrive after 3:30 so I don't leave before
you get there.</p>
<p>We can also schedule a remote meeting on a different day if you can't meet with
me after class. If you'd like to meet remotely, then please send me an email
with your availability over the next 2-3 days. I'll try to find a time that
works for both of us and schedule a meeting.</p>
<h2 id="blackboard"><a class="header" href="#blackboard">Blackboard</a></h2>
<p>I will post or link to all course material and assignments on Blackboard. If you
want to find something or submit an assignment, go to our Blackboard site and
look in the appropriate page. If you think I forgot to post something, then send
me an email and I'll either post it or tell you where to find it.</p>
<p>I combine my Blackboard sites when teaching multiple sections of the same class,
but the inactive sites for individual sections may still show up. The correct
Blackboard site for this class is CSC110_Merge_Kohlberg_24FA.</p>
<h2 id="email"><a class="header" href="#email">Email</a></h2>
<p>My email is <a href="mailto:zckohlberg@qu.edu">zckohlberg@qu.edu</a>. I check my email most weekdays and try to
respond to all emails within 24 hours. If you email me after Friday morning or
on the weekend, then I probably won't see it until Monday. You're still welcome
to email me at any time.</p>
<p>I will answer most questions via email if you don't want to ask in person. If
you're asking for help with an assignment, coding issue, or software, then
please attach your code (the text file, not a screenshot). Try to include as
much relevant information as possible and be specific about what you want to
know. This helps me give you a useful answer more quickly.</p>
<p>If you want me to do something more involved than answer a few questions, such
as review your code or help you debug a program, then you should meet with me
during office hours. I'm happy to help you with coding, debugging, and other
tasks as long as you're the one doing the task. You should not come to office
hours or send an email expecting me to do your work for you.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="class-meetings"><a class="header" href="#class-meetings">Class Meetings</a></h1>
<h2 id="instructor-absence"><a class="header" href="#instructor-absence">Instructor Absence</a></h2>
<p>I may hold class remotely via Zoom if I cannot attend the meeting in person (for
example, if I'm sick). If I need to cancel class, then I will notify everyone as
early as possible in a Blackboard announcement.</p>
<h2 id="class-structure"><a class="header" href="#class-structure">Class Structure</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KJqEeECG5KDjD-ECmzzUYWHLkJZRYeBfTT9YTCF5f_g/edit?usp=sharing">course schedule</a> will have the
agenda for each class meeting, and all activities and material from class will
be posted online. If you want me to cover a specific topic or spend more time on
something, then let me know and I will try to fit it into the agenda for an
upcoming class.</p>
<p>My goal this semester is to run CSC110 as a &quot;flipped&quot; class. Rather than giving
traditional lectures during class, material will be introduced outside of class
with videos and reading assignments. Class meetings will instead focus on
practice activities, projects, and reviews. If I'm not able to prepare
sufficient material later in the semester, or if this structure doesn't work for
us, then we may switch back to a more traditional structure with in-class
lectures.</p>
<p>You should show up to each class prepared for what we're doing that day, which
means completing any reading or other homework assignments before class starts.
Showing up to a group activity unprepared is disrespectful to the people you are
working with and may delay starting the activity.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-policy"><a class="header" href="#attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</a></h2>
<p>You should attend class whenever possible, but you do not need my permission to
miss class or leave early. You also don't need to explain absences to me.
However, I would appreciate knowing what's going on if you have to miss multiple
classes in a row or are absent frequently. The university expects me to contact
your academic advisor when you have excessive or consecutive unexcused absences.</p>
<p>If you are feeling sick or suspect you may have COVID, the flu, or another
contagious illness, then please stay home and focus on recovering. You will be
okay if you miss a few classes, and you're not likely to get much out of class
while you aren't feeling well. Attending class while sick also poses a risk to
everyone else.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="course-material"><a class="header" href="#course-material">Course Material</a></h1>
<h2 id="primary-resources"><a class="header" href="#primary-resources">Primary Resources</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Lessons</strong>: Professor Blake and I are creating video lessons to cover
most of the topics in this class. These are intended to introduce topics and
prepare you for in-class activities.</li>
<li><strong>Class Activities/Examples</strong>: We will have practice activities during class,
coding demonstrations, and reviews in which I show solutions to previous
activities. Any examples that I create during class will be posted online
after the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Notes</strong>: I'm in the process of revising my notes for this class, and they
will be updated frequently during the semester. I use the notes for reading
assignments after we've covered a topic in class.</li>
<li><strong>Textbooks</strong>: You do not need to purchase any textbooks for this class. I try
to cover everything in my notes, but you may want to use a textbook for
further reading or to see a different explanation of a topic. I've linked two
free textbooks from <a href="https://libretexts.org/">libretexts.org</a> below. I may
also use these for reading assignments if I'm behind on my notes:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_and_Computation_Fundamentals/Book%3A_Programming_Fundamentals_(Busbee_and_Braunschweig)/00%3A_Front_Matter/03%3A_Table_of_Contents">Programming and Computation Fundamentals, by Busbee and Braunschweig</a></li>
<li><a href="https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_and_Computation_Fundamentals/Computer_Science_from_the_Bottom_Up_(Wienand)">Computer Science from the Bottom Up, by Wienand</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software"><a class="header" href="#software">Software</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text Editors</strong>: You need a text editor to edit code (Microsoft Word and
Google Docs are <strong>not</strong> text editors). I've listed a few suggestions below,
but there are many other options out there. It does not matter to me which
editor you use as long as you learn how to use it.
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a></strong>: I believe this is the most
popular editor currently available. I recommend using it unless you have a
good reason to go with another editor. One caveat: I do not personally use
VS Code, and I cannot provide much technical support for it. However, due to
its popularity you should be able to find plenty of resources online.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></strong>: I like Notepad++, but it's
Windows only and I haven't used it in years. It still appears to be
receiving regular updates, so it should be a reasonable choice if you're
using Windows and don't like VS Code.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a></strong>: This is the editor I use. It's harder to
learn than the other options in this list, but it's powerful and highly
configurable. If you don't mind spending time learning vim motions and
various keyboard shortcuts, then it might be worth giving neovim a try. You
could also consider <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>, both of which have similar
pros and cons to neovim. However, I think most people will be happier with
VS Code, so I don't recommend these options unless one appeals to you and
you're fine with the learning curve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Java</strong>: This is the programming language we're using. You'll set up Java
during the first lab, and I'll post directions on Blackboard in case you need
to reinstall it in the future.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git Bash</a></strong>: We'll use a terminal regularly. I
don't like the default terminal programs on Windows (cmd and Powershell), and
some of the scripts and commands I give you will not work in either of them.
Git for Windows comes with a decent bash emulator, and I highly recommend it
over cmd and Powershell if you use Windows. If you're using a Mac or Linux
computer, then the default terminal program (usually bash or zsh) is fine.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">diagrams.net</a></strong>: This is a web app for creating
flowcharts and other diagrams. It can also integrate with Google Drive and
allow multiple people to edit the same diagram, but some students have
reported issues with lag while doing this.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-resources"><a class="header" href="#other-resources">Other Resources</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs//api/index.html">Java API</a>
is a useful reference. It may be intimidating right now, but the more you learn
about Java and programming in general, the more easily you'll be able to
navigate the API and use it to look up information.</p>
<p>Finally, asking good questions is one of the most useful skills you can have as
a student. In my experience, most people (myself included) don't ask questions
as often as they should, and it can be difficult to ask a question that will
quickly lead to a helpful answer. I think the blog posts below provide excellent
advice for asking and answering questions:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="assignments"><a class="header" href="#assignments">Assignments</a></h1>
<h2 id="projects"><a class="header" href="#projects">Projects</a></h2>
<p>I will assign several projects during the semester, and I've created a separate
website covering the details of these projects. Each project falls into one of
the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Guided Project</strong> provides step-by-step instructions for writing a program.
These steps won't tell you exactly what to code, but they break the program
into a series of smaller problems that you can solve one at a time.</li>
<li>An <strong>Expanded Project</strong> builds on previous Guided Projects to create a more
complete program. It is significantly more complex than a Guided Project, and
you will not be given step-by-step directions for completing each task. You
also have the option to propose an alternative version of the assignment.</li>
<li>A <strong>Self-Directed Project</strong> requires you to design your own program and submit
a proposal describing it. Self-Directed Projects are optional and can be used
to replace any of the other projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-submission"><a class="header" href="#project-submission">Project Submission</a></h2>
<p>All projects must be submitted on Blackboard, and most projects must pass a set
of tests to be considered complete. To make it easier for me to check new
submissions frequently, I require projects to be zipped in a particular format.
I will provide a program that checks whether your project passes these tests and
then zips your project in the correct format.</p>
<p>If a project submission is improperly zipped, is missing any tasks/deliverables,
or does not pass the required test cases, then that submission will be marked as
incomplete. You may resubmit the project as long as you follow the restrictions
in the deadlines section below.</p>
<h2 id="deadlines"><a class="header" href="#deadlines">Deadlines</a></h2>
<p>I don't like assigning deadlines for assignments unless there is a compelling
reason that I need your work by a particular time or need to otherwise limit
submissions. If I do set a deadline or other restriction, then I will explain
why.</p>
<p>The following restrictions apply to project submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are allowed to submit Guided Project assignments as often as you like
until 11:59 PM ET on Sunday, December 8th.</li>
<li>You can submit up to one proposal for a Self-Directed Project or an
alternative Expanded Project every week.</li>
<li>You can submit up to one Self-Directed Project or Expanded Project (I'll refer
to these as the open-ended projects) each week.</li>
<li>If a project requires me to approve a proposal, then you cannot submit that
project until the week after you submit the proposal.</li>
<li>The cutoff for weekly proposal/project submissions is
11:59 PM ET on Sunday. If you submit after this time, then it
will count as your submission for the following week. The final weekly
deadline is 11:59 PM ET on Sunday, December 8th.</li>
<li>I will not accept any late submissions and will strictly enforce all
deadlines. The deadline for Guided Projects and final weekly deadline for
open-ended projects is your last opportunity to submit work for this class.</li>
</ul>
<p>My reasons for these restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Guided Project assignments can be fully checked by my test program and a
couple of scripts, so they take little time for me to review. I leave myself a
week at the end of the semester to determine final grades, review projects one
last time, and resolve academic integrity cases.</li>
<li>I chose to go with weekly project/proposal submissions instead of
project-specific deadlines to keep the open-ended projects more flexible. The
limit of one per week ensures I don't get flooded with too many late in the
semester. I aim to review them within a week of the cut-off so you can have
timely feedback.</li>
<li>I give specific times and enforce deadlines strictly to ensure I handle
assignment submissions consistently and fairly. It doesn't matter how close
you are to a missed deadline or what excuse you offer. You either submit the
assignment on time or arrange for an extension (see below); otherwise, I will
not accept the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extensions-and-other-exceptions"><a class="header" href="#extensions-and-other-exceptions">Extensions and Other Exceptions</a></h2>
<p>In rare cases (such as medical or family emergencies), I will allow an extension
to a deadline or an exception to another restriction on submitting an
assignment. You can email me to ask for a such an exception if you believe one
is appropriate in your situation. Your email should include an explanation of
why you need the extension, a new proposed deadline (or other proposed change to
existing restrictions), and your current progress on the assignment. Be sure to
send me your code and any other material you've created for the assignment so
far.</p>
<p>I have some expectations if I am going to give an extension or make an exception
to a class policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've demonstrated that you read this policy by including <em>all</em> of the
information I just asked for.</li>
<li>If you're having trouble with the assignment, then you're taking steps to get
help. Usually this means seeing a tutor or going to office hours.</li>
<li>You are clearly making an effort to keep up with the class and not
procrastinating. If there is an ongoing problem affecting your work or
participation in the class and you want me to accommodate you, then you must
let me know early and keep me informed as that situation develops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions and other exceptions are given on a case-by-case basis. I will try to
be as fair as possible, but this comes down to my judgement and whether you've
been proactively communicating with me.</p>
<h2 id="advice"><a class="header" href="#advice">Advice</a></h2>
<p>If you struggle with deadlines or time management, then I'd like to offer some
advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start your work early. You have four to six assignments to complete depending
on your desired grade, and you probably won't be ready to start them for the
first few weeks of class. It's not a big workload if you spread it out, but it
will be overwhelming if you let it pile up towards the end of the semester.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlines in this class are not targets.</strong> If I give you a deadline, then
this is the latest that I'm willing to accept the assignment under most
circumstances. I expect you to finish and submit the assignment much earlier.
If you plan to submit something the night it's due, then there's a good chance
you'll miss that deadline. I can't stop you from taking this risk, but you
have to accept the consequences if it doesn't work out.</li>
<li>There are people you can talk to if you need help. Talk to someone when you
<em>start</em> having trouble; don't wait until you feel hopelessly stuck or
overwhelmed. And if you did wait until you were overwhelmed, that doesn't mean
it's too late to get help! That just means it's even more urgent that you ask
for help <em>now</em>, and that it may take more effort to catch up.
<ul>
<li>I'm available by email and during
<a href="./communication.html#office-hours">office hours</a>.</li>
<li>The Learning Commons employs peer tutors who can help you with this class.</li>
<li>Academic coaches can be reached by email and are available by appointment.
They may not be able to help you with your code, but they're great to talk
to if you have trouble with time management or adjusting to college.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep backups of your work in case you have a problem with your computer.
Google Drive and Dropbox both have free plans, and I believe you can use
OneDrive for free through your QU account. You can also download any work you
previously submitted on Blackboard.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-assignments"><a class="header" href="#other-assignments">Other Assignments</a></h2>
<p>There will be other assignments in addition to the projects. For example, I may
ask you to read a section of my notes, view a video, or complete a practice
activity. While I may not deduct points from your grade if you miss these
assignments, ignoring reading and practice assignments may result in you not
acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge to complete the major projects,
which means they can still <em>indirectly</em> affect your final grade. I try not to
assign work frivilously, and I expect you to complete assignments whether or not
I attach a grade to them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="grading"><a class="header" href="#grading">Grading</a></h1>
<p>This class uses a labor-based grading system. I don't expect most students to be
familiar with labor-based grading, so before I get into our particular version,
I'd like to introduce the concept and explain why we're using it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-labor-based-grading"><a class="header" href="#what-is-labor-based-grading">What is Labor-Based Grading?</a></h2>
<p>Labor-based grading and contract grading are approaches to grading that try to
emphasize the work you put into a class over the outcomes of that work. This
grading system specifies what work you need to complete to earn a particular
final grade, and individual assignments are not graded. You receive a final
grade based on what work you complete rather than a weighted average of grades
from assignments and exams.</p>
<p>There are plenty of articles online about labor-based grading if you want to
read about it in more detail. Here's one that was easy to find and that I think
explains the concept well: <a href="https://cep.barnard.edu/labor-based-grading">https://cep.barnard.edu/labor-based-grading</a>. This
article also links to an example grade contract. My implementation will differ,
but my goals are largely the same.</p>
<h2 id="why-labor-based-grading"><a class="header" href="#why-labor-based-grading">Why Labor-Based Grading?</a></h2>
<p>The author of the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I9hjemH4qo5nQYa89WW-3udW-oz4cYDoly25m8yaiik/edit?usp=sharing">example grade contract</a>
shown in the Bernard College webpage gives an excellent explanation of why they
prefer contract grading over traditional grades. I recommend reading that if you
want to hear more about the motivation behind labor-based grading. I'll try to
summarize why I dislike traditional grading systems and think this system
addresses some (but not all) of the problems with grades.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grades are not a good source of feedback.</strong> Grades provide little
information on their own compared to comments and other qualitative feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Grades punish you for mistakes.</strong> Whether intended or not, low grades act as
a punishment. Mistakes are a necessary part of the learning process, and you
should not be penalized for them. Giving lower grades to indicate mistakes or
areas for improvement is counterproductive.</li>
<li><strong>A laber-based grading system is more transparent than a weighted average.</strong>
If you want a particular grade, then you know exactly which assignments you
must complete for that grade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-grading-system"><a class="header" href="#the-grading-system">The Grading System</a></h2>
<p>Previous versions of this syllabus required you to choose a final grade and
submit a grade contract with the terms for that grade. After trying this a few
times, I don't think requiring everyone to submit their own contract is worth
the trouble. Instead, I've listed each possible grade along with the required
work to earn that grade. At the end of the semester, you will receive the
highest final grade for which you qualify. You qualify for a grade if you meet
<em>every</em> requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li>For an A:
<ul>
<li>Complete all Guided Project assignments (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2)</li>
<li>Complete <strong>two</strong> Expanded Project assignments (1.3, 2.3)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For a B:
<ul>
<li>Complete all Guided Project assignments (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2)</li>
<li>Complete <strong>one</strong> Expanded Project assignment (1.3, 2.3)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For a C:
<ul>
<li>Complete all Guided Project assignments (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For a D:
<ul>
<li>Complete <strong>three</strong> of the four Guided Project assignments (1.1, 1.2, 2.1,
2.2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For an F:
<ul>
<li>Don't meet the requirements for any of the above grades</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Self-Directed Project can be used to replace an Expanded Project or a pair
of Guided Projects. You can complete multiple Self-Directed Projects to replace
additional assignments.</p>
<h2 id="faq"><a class="header" href="#faq">FAQ</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>If I'm not graded on an assignment, does that mean I don't need to put any
effort into it?</strong> I review assignments and check that they were completed as
directed. Not receiving a grade on your assignment doesn't mean you don't have
to do any work or put effort into your work. You should still expect these
assignments to challenge you and require a significant amount of work.</li>
<li><strong>Why can't I get an A+?</strong> QU's
<a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/academics/grading-system/">grading system</a> does not
include an A+. The highest grade you can earn in any QU class is an A.</li>
<li><strong>Why can't I get an A-, B+, B-, C+, or C-?</strong> I don't see a reason to include
an option for every in-between grade. An A is the highest grade you can earn,
a B is less demanding but good grade, and a C represents the minimum
requirements to pass this class and take more CSC/SER courses.</li>
<li><strong>Is there extra credit?</strong> There is no extra credit, but there are multiple
ways to meet the requirements for any grade contract. You can replace anything
with a Self-Directed Project, and you can propose alternative versions of
Expanded Projects.</li>
<li><strong>Can I get partial credit on an assignment?</strong> There is no partial credit for
late or incomplete assignments. You must complete the entire assignment,
submit it on time, and submit it in the correct format to receive credit for
it. If you're having trouble, then please ask me or a tutor for help.</li>
<li><strong>Are there exams?</strong> Graded exams, quizzes, and similar assessments don't work
with this grading system. There are no exams, not even a final exam. However,
I may give ungraded quizzes as a way for you to check your understanding of
topics we've covered.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about the grading system that aren't answered here, then
please don't hesitate to ask me about it! I want you to feel comfortable with
the grading system and understand what's required to earn the grade you want.</p>

employs academic coaches who work with first-year students.</p>
<p>Below is some additional information about the Learning Commons and their
contact information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Learning Commons is a place for students to go when they want to achieve a
level of performance they can’t reach on their own. In a setting of practice
and growth, student resources are provided through Peer Educator programs, the
Office of Student Accessibility, and Academic Development &amp; Outreach
professional staff. The Learning Commons can be found at the Mount Carmel
Campus in the North wing of the Arnold Bernhard Library; and at the North
Haven Campus on the third floor of the Law School (SLE-340). Students are
encouraged to visit The Learning Commons for support with class content, to

<p>Finally, I want to add that your mental and physical health are more important
than your classes. If you're struggling with class due to mental health issues
or notice that you're developing unhealthy habits to cope with your workload,
then please talk to someone as early as possible. I'll try to work with you if
you tell me about a problem you're experiencing, and the earlier we talk the

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="academic-integrity-ai-policy"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-ai-policy">Academic Integrity (AI) Policy</a></h1>
<p>Here is a link to Quinnipiac University's Academic Integrity (AI) policy:
<a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/academic-integrity-policy/">https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/academic-integrity-policy/</a>. This
policy applies to all courses at QU, and this part of the syllabus goes into
detail about how the AI policy works in our class. From this point forward I
will assume you are familiar with the school's AI policy.</p>
<h2 id="permission-to-share-and-discuss-work"><a class="header" href="#permission-to-share-and-discuss-work">Permission to Share and Discuss Work</a></h2>
<p>I consider it important that you can freely discuss assignments with other
students. Your peers can be an excellent source of help and feedback, and your
own insights and feedback can greatly help other students. I don't want the
school's or my AI policies to discourage you from talking to anyone else about
your work. Therefore, this section serves as my explicit written permission to
do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may share work you create for this class with anybody, including your
classmates, and publicly post this work online.</li>
<li>You may discuss assignments from this class with anybody. You may ask anybody
for help with these assignments and view their work if they are willing to
share it with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, you own all the work you do for this class, and that means you
decide what to do with it. However, I need to clarify that this permission does
not extend to the following actions, all of which directly violate the school's
AI policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may not share work or post it publicly for the purpose of helping someone
else violate the school's AI policy. This includes if somebody asks you for
your work and informs you that they plan to copy it before you share the work
with them. See the section on &quot;Facilitation and Collusion&quot; in the school's AI
policy.</li>
<li>You may not copy your work from other people or from a large language model
(an &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; program). I'll cover this in more detail in a
later section.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not consider you responsible for anyone's misuse of material that you
shared in good faith. I will always take your word regarding how you intended or
expected your work to be used unless I have strong evidence that contradicts
you.</p>
<h2 id="what-counts-as-plagiarism"><a class="header" href="#what-counts-as-plagiarism">What Counts as Plagiarism?</a></h2>
<p>First and most important: <strong>in any situation where you have doubts or are unsure
whether an action would violate this policy, ask me!</strong> It's always okay to ask
whether you <em>can</em> do something.</p>
<p>This section exists for two reasons: to make it easier for someone who has
genuine questions to determine whether an action qualifies as cheating, and to
give me something to point to if somebody claims they didn't know their actions
qualified as cheating. Going through a series of flimsy excuses is one of the
most tedious parts of handling an AI violation, so I'd like to be thorough here
and save myself some trouble later.</p>
<p>This will focus on plagiarism on programming assignments. I'll use the phrase
&quot;<strong>other work</strong>&quot; to refer to any work that was created by somebody other than
you or by an LLM (such as ChatGPT). The following actions will nearly always
violate the AI policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying <strong>other work</strong> in whole or in part, whether by copying the file,
copying and pasting the file's contents, or viewing the file and retyping the
same information by hand. Modifying <strong>other work</strong> after copying it, whether
to disguise the copying or &quot;make it your own&quot; (an excuse I've heard
frequently) does not change the fact that it was copied. What matters is that
you copied work, not how you copied it or what you did before or after copying
it.</li>
<li>Paraphrasing <strong>other work</strong> in whole or in part. As far as I'm concerned, this
is the same as copying. In my experience, some paraphrasing is often used to
disguise that work was copied, and the claim that work was paraphrased is used
as an excuse to deny having copied work.</li>
<li>Using <strong>other work</strong> as a reference when creating your own work. This normally
results in copying or paraphrasing as described above, but I mention it
because it's another common excuse used to explain evidence of copying.</li>
<li>Doing your work under the direction of another person. It's okay to talk to
someone about your work while you're working, but it's not okay to let them
dictate the code to you. If you're mostly writing what someone else tells you
to write, then you are not doing your own work. Try talking to them about your
problem, taking some notes, and then fixing the problem on your own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions to the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use material that I intentionally provide you (such as my notes,
starter code, assignment descriptions, or examples from class) with or without
modification in your own work for this class. You don't need to document your
use of such material because it is expected and obvious from context.</li>
<li>If you want to copy or paraphrase from another source, then you can as long as
you do the following:
<ul>
<li>Discuss it with me first and get my permission to use the other work on the
assignment.</li>
<li>Clearly state which outside sources you used and provide a reliable link or
other means to access those sources.</li>
<li>Clearly show what was taken from the other source and what is your own
original work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Two general rules I use if someone appears to have plagiarized but claims they
did not:</p>
<ul>
<li>If large sections of your code are identical or nearly identical to existing
code, then it isn't your work. If you are writing your own code and following
the guidelines I provide in this policy, then you should always end up with
significantly different code on all but the simplest programs.</li>
<li>If you don't understand your code and cannot explain how it works, then it
isn't your work. You should not be using code that you don't understand, and
you are not going to accidentally write a working program that solves a
specific problem without some understanding of the code you're writing. If
your code doesn't appear to be something a student realistically would have
written and you cannot explain how it works, then I will not accept it for an
assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="retaking-this-class-and-self-plagiarism"><a class="header" href="#retaking-this-class-and-self-plagiarism">Retaking this Class and Self-Plagiarism</a></h3>
<p>If you are retaking this class, then I expect you to complete every assignment
from scratch without reusing any of your old work. I consider reusing work from
the last time you took this class equivalent to reusing work you completed for a
different class (&quot;double-dipping&quot; in QU's AI policy).</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-and-llms"><a class="header" href="#chatgpt-and-llms">ChatGPT and LLMs</a></h2>
<p>You're free to discuss assignments with LLMs such as ChatGPT, but I do not
recommend using them for this class. While we might colloquially refer to an LLM
as an &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; these tools are not intelligent and do not
understand the conversation they are having with you. They are complex
algorithms running on powerful hardware, and they are very good at one thing:
using their training data to produce text that looks like something a human
might write in the context of your conversation. LLMs are prone to hallucinating
(making up false information), and they do not know when they are hallucinating.
These tools are most useful in the hands of an expert who can critically
evaluate the information generated by an LLM. You are most likely not an expert
at this point.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, I treat material generated by an LLM the same as material
created by another person for the purpose of this AI policy. It is not your
work, and using this material in an assignment violates this policy.</p>
<p>If you are using ChatGPT for help with an assignment, then please save that
conversation so you can share it with me or the AI Office if your work is called
into question. This is an easy way to establish whether you used the tool
appropriately, and if you cannot or will not provide that evidence then I will
not give you the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<h2 id="consequences-for-ai-violations"><a class="header" href="#consequences-for-ai-violations">Consequences for AI Violations</a></h2>
<p>Consequences for AI violations are determined either by joint resolution, case
review, or a hearing. In a joint resolution, you and I must agree to any
proposed consequences, and in a case review or hearing I will still be consulted
about appropriate consequences. This section covers what I believe are
appropriate consequences <em>on a first offense</em> for most AI violations.</p>
<p>If you plagiarize, cheat, or otherwise violate the AI policy on an assignment,
then under no circumstances will I consider it appropriate to give you credit
for the assignment. This is <strong>not</strong> a punishment for cheating, it is simply
enforcing the requirements of the grading system. If you copied or cheated on
even a small portion of the assignment, <strong>then you did not complete the entire
assignment</strong>; you completed <em>some</em> of the assignment and then copied the
remaining work. To give any credit, full or partial, would be a reward for
cheating.</p>
<p>In addition to enforcing the normal penalty for incomplete work, I consider the
following consequences to be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you cheat on one assignment, then your final grade should be reduced by one
letter grade after accounting for the incomplete assignment. I will not allow
you to redo the assignment, but you may replace the assignment with a
Self-Directed Project if there is enough time remaining. If there isn't enough
time to complete a Self-Directed Project, then I will <strong>not</strong> give you an
extension.</li>
<li>If you cheat on multiple assignments, then you should receive a final grade of
F. Depending on the extent or nature of this cheating (for example, if you
cheat on more than two assignments), further penalties may be appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lab"><a class="header" href="#lab">Lab</a></h1>
<p>The lab is a separate class from the lecture. I do not have any lab sections
this semester, so if you're reading this then you should just have me for the
lecture. However, there are still a few things I want to mention about the lab:</p>
<ul>
<li>You receive a separate final grade in the lab, and it may differ from your
final grade in this class. Only your work for the lecture affects your grade
in the lecture, and only your work in the lab affects your grade in the lab.
Passing one class doesn't guarantee you'll pass the other.</li>
<li>The lab has a separate Blackboard page and syllabus. Make sure you're on the
correct Blackboard page when submitting assignments or looking for class
material.</li>
</ul>
