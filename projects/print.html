<p>This book contains all of the projects for CSC110. Most of the projects are
organized into sets: <a href="./project1.html">Project Set 1: Character Sheet</a>,
<a href="./project2.html">Project Set 2: Dice Game</a>.</p>
<p><a href="./self_directed.html">Self-Directed Projects</a> are optional and don't belong to
any of the project sets.</p>
<p>The <a href="./setup">Project Directory Setup</a> section explains how to organize your
projects to ensure compatibility with my tests.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="project-directory-setup"><a class="header" href="#project-directory-setup">Project Directory Setup</a></h1>
<p>Before you start working on any projects, you should create folders to store
your project files. I would like you to use a specific structure for a few
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>My test program expects your projects to be organized a certain way. You may
not be able to run the tests if you don't organize your projects as shown
below.</li>
<li>When I download projects from Blackboard, I process them automatically with
some scripts. This saves me hours of organizing and renaming everyone's files
throughout the semester. My scripts also handle testing the projects, and
they'll use the same test program I give you. If your submission isn't
organized correctly, then my scripts will not be able to extract the project
files and run the tests, and your submission will be marked incomplete.</li>
<li>Keeping your work organized will make it easier for <em>you</em> to keep track of
everything.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-directory-structure"><a class="header" href="#project-directory-structure">Project Directory Structure</a></h2>
<p>Your project directory (folder) should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>projects/
├── project1/
│   ├── part1/
│   ├── part2/
│   └── part3/
└── project2/
    ├── part1/
    ├── part2/
    └── part3/
</code></pre>
<p>Everything you need to submit should go in the folder for that project. For
example, your code for Guided Project 1.1 would go in the folder
<code>projects/project1/part1</code>. Each folder name must only contain lowercase letters,
and the spelling must match exactly what is shown above. The <code>/</code> at the end of
each name indicates that the name refers to a directory rather than a regular
file.</p>
<p>You can create these directories however you want, but I recommend using the
terminal. The following command creates all project folders with the correct
names:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir -p projects/project{1,2}/part{1,2,3}
</code></pre>
<p>The name of the root folder (<code>projects</code>) doesn't technically matter, so you can
change that to a different name if you prefer. Just make sure the name doesn't
contain any spaces.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="project-set-1-character-sheet"><a class="header" href="#project-set-1-character-sheet">Project Set 1: Character Sheet</a></h1>
<p>For this project, we will write a program that assists the user in creating
their character for a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG). This game will be
similar to Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition (D&amp;D 5e), but many of the rules
will be omitted or simplifed.</p>
<h2 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a> is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">tabletop roleplaying game</a>.
Even if you haven't played a TTRPG before, you've probably heard the name
&quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; at some point. This assignment will use a modified
version of some character creation rules from D&amp;D 5e. The real rules can be
found in the <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/">5e System Reference Document</a> (SRD), which
you can read if you're curious and want to learn more. However, you do not need
to read the SRD for this assignment.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of some terms that will come up in this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>player</strong> is a real person playing the game, and their <strong>character</strong> or
<strong>player character</strong> (<strong>pc</strong> for short) is the fictional character they
control within the game.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>class</strong> is the role they fill in the game's world. In a game
like D&amp;D, which focuses on fighting fantasy monsters, a character's class
tells us their role in combat. A wizard casts spells, a rogue sneaks up on
enemies, and a fighter... fights. Yes, everyone fights, but the fighter fights
more directly, like with a sword and shield.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ancestry</strong> or <strong>race</strong> (the term varies by game, but I'll
usually go with ancestry when not talking about a specific game) represents
what kind of creature they are. Standard D&amp;D races include elf, human, dwarf,
goblin, gnome, halfling, and orc. However, depending on the game and who's
running it, a TTRPG character could be anything: a ghost, a dragon, a talking
bear, or a mannequin. I have run a game of D&amp;D that included both a talking
bear and a mannequin. The mannequin also talked, not just the bear.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>HP</strong> or <strong>hit points</strong> represent how difficult they are to
defeat in combat.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>AC</strong> or <strong>armor class</strong> represents how hard they are to hit
with an attack. A high AC may mean that a character is very good at avoiding
attacks, or that a character is wearing armor that blocks most attacks.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability scores</strong> are numbers that represent a character's
strength, cunning, speed, and other qualities that affect most of their
actions in the game.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability modifiers</strong> are bonuses or penalties derived from
their ability scores. The modifiers are the numbers we actually use in most
calculations, and the scores only exist to determine the modifiers. At this
point, you may be wondering why we bother with ability scores if we don't use
them after calculating the modifiers. That's an excellent question!</li>
<li>A character's <strong>level</strong> represents how powerful and experienced they are. In
most RPGs, characters gain experience and level up to represent how they've
grown during their adventures.</li>
<li>In addition to standard six-sided dice (referred to as D6 dice), D&amp;D uses
several less common dice shapes: D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20.</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>I recommend using comments to divide your program into sections so that it's
easier to stay organized. I'll be referring to three different parts of the
program in these steps: input, calculations, and output. Before the input
section, add comments with a title for the program and the author's name
(that's you). Feel free to copy the template below and fill in the missing
information.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// Project 1.1: Character Sheet
// Author: your name here

///////////
// Input //
///////////

// TODO: prompt for user input

//////////////////
// Calculations //
//////////////////

// TODO: calculations

////////////
// Output //
////////////

// TODO: print character sheet
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the input section, prompt the user for the following information in order:
their name, their character's name, their character's level, and their
character's ability scores (strength, dexterity, and constitution). When you
prompt the user for input, remember that this involves two lines of code:
<ul>
<li>A <code>println</code> to ask the user for input. You want the user to know that
they're expected to type something, and you want them to know <em>what</em>
they're expected to type. You can word this however you want. This
project's requirements do not specify the wording of any prompts, and the
tests will not check your prompts.</li>
<li>Declare a new variable to hold the input value and initialize it by calling
the appropriate input function (in this project, we will only use
<code>nextLine</code> and <code>nextInt</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test your program. You should see the first input prompt, and then the
program should pause until you enter your input before moving to the next
prompt. After all of the prompts finish, you'll be left in Jshell. Try
entering the name of each variable you created. You should see the values you
typed earlier when the program was asking you for input.</li>
<li>In the calculations section, calculate the character's HP (hit points), AC
(armor class), and attack bonus. Each of these properties should be a new
variable. Test your program after you finish and check the values of the hp,
ac, and attack bonus variables. Do the calculations yourself to confirm the
values shown in jshell are correct. Use the following formulas to calculate
these properties:
<ul>
<li>The character's HP is equal to their level multiplied by their constitution
score.</li>
<li>The character's AC is equal to ten plus their dexterity score.</li>
<li>The character's attack bonus is equal to their level plus their strength
score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print all of the information shown in the I/O Format section. You can insert
your variable into the output using string concatenation: write the label as
a string literal, then add the appropriate variable. For example, if your
player's name is in a variable called <code>playerName</code>, then you could print
<code>&quot;Player: &quot; + playerName</code> for the first line of the character sheet.</li>
<li>Before you run my test program, try running your program yourself and make
sure the output looks correct. It will be nice to see the whole program
working, and you can spot the more obvious mistakes on your own.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="task-2-run-tests"><a class="header" href="#task-2-run-tests">Task 2: Run Tests</a></h3>
<p>Run the tests for your project and look at the feedback. If your code passed

<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This program requires two additional pieces of input. Prompt the player for
their character's ancestry and class after the character name and before the
level. Test these new prompts like you tested the prompts in 1.1: run the
program, make sure the prompts appear, and make sure the variables have the
expected value after all of the prompts are finished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the user enters invalid input, then our program must print an error
message and exit. You should modify your prompts to tell the user what input
is allowed for the ancestry, class, level, and ability scores. This will be a
helpful reminder when you test the program.</p>
<p>Note: You can check each input value immediately after the prompt, or you can
check all of them in a separate section of your program after all of the
input is finished. The first option will give a better user experience
because you will know right away when you make a mistake, and you won't waste
time entering more input before the program exits. It also makes your program
faster to test for the same reasons. The second option makes it a little
easier to organize the code, and all of the error-checking could be combined
into one if statement. I recommend the first option because I believe you'll
benefit the most from the ease of testing. My directions will only describe
how to code this option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add an if statement after the level prompt. A <em>valid</em> level is an integer
between 1 and 20, inclusive. We want to check whether it is <em>invalid</em>, so we
need a condition that asks whether the level is outside of this range. An
invalid level is <strong>either</strong> less than 1 <strong>or</strong> greater than 20. There are two
parts to this condition, so we need to join them with an AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) or an OR
(<code>||</code>). In this case, we should use OR. There are a couple of ways to
determine that OR is appropriate: the wording of the condition when we
describe it in English only makes sense with the word &quot;or&quot;, and we only need
to meet one of these two conditions for the level to be invalid (it's not
even possible for it to be both less than 1 and greater than 20 at the same
time). In the body of our if statement, we need to print an error message and
exit our program. The exact error message is <code>ERROR: INVALID INPUT</code>, and we
can exit the program with <code>System.exit(1);</code>. Any integer is a valid argument
for the <code>System.exit</code> function, but a value other than 0 means the program
encountered an error. All together, the prompt with error checking would look
something like this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// prompt for input
System.out.println(&quot;level prompt message&quot;);
int variableName = nextInt();

// check for invalid input
if (/*TODO: condition*/) {
    println(&quot;ERROR: INVALID INPUT&quot;);
    // The /exit command won't work here because this whole block is part of a
    // Java code snippet. Jshell expects everything in a snippet to be valid
    // Java code.
    exit(1);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>You can use a similar prompt to check each ability score. The ability scores
must be integers between 8 and 15 inclusive. After you add the error-checking
for the level and abilities, you should test each of them a few times. Try a
few values inside and outside the range, and make sure the program exits with
the error message if and only if you enter a value outside the range. In
particular, you should check the boundaries of the range. One of the most
common mistakes in this type of code is to make a range inclusive when it
should have been exclusive, or to make it exclusive when it should have been
inclusive. If you make that mistake, then your code will work correctly for
all but one or two numbers. You should check 0, 1, 20, and 21 for the level,
as well as 7, 8, 15, and 16 for each ability score.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once your error-checking code works for the numbers, you also need to check
the ancestry and class. Each of these have three options, and the user's
input is invalid if it is not equal to one of these options. This means we
have three parts to our condition, and they must be joined with AND or OR.
Which is appropriate? Let's try describing invalid input more closely to how
we would code it (checking each possibility separately) and see whether AND
or OR is more natural: an invalid ancestry is <strong>not</strong> an elf <strong>and</strong> it is
<strong>not</strong> a dwarf <strong>and</strong> it is <strong>not</strong> a human. Therefore we should use AND
(<code>&amp;&amp;</code>).</p>
<p>However, this can be tricky. There's another way to phrase our condition that
sounds natural and uses OR instead of AND: &quot;an invalid ancestry is not an
elf, dwarf, <strong>or</strong> human&quot;. Does this mean it doesn't matter whether we use
AND or OR? No, it still matters. The trick with this phrase is how it looks
when structured like code: &quot;it is <strong>not</strong> true that (an invalid ancestry is
an elf <strong>or</strong> it is a dwarf <strong>or</strong> it is a human).&quot; We are using <strong>or</strong> to
join several equality checks (instead of inequality checks), then applying
the NOT (<code>!</code>) to the entire expression, which I've indicated by wrapping most
of the expression in parenthesis.</p>
<p>You'll develop an intuition for boolean logic with practice, so don't worry
if you had a hard time with this part. I'll summarize everything you need to
know for the AND solution to this error check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check whether the ancestry/class is NOT equal to each option.</li>
<li>Join each of these comparisons with AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>).</li>
<li>Never compare strings with <code>s1 == s2</code> or <code>s1 != s2</code>. This will not work as
you want it to. Instead, compare them using the <code>.equals</code> function:
<code>s1.equals(s2)</code> for equality and <code>!s1.equals(s2)</code> for inequality.</li>
<li>Valid ancestries are &quot;elf&quot;, &quot;human&quot;, and &quot;dwarf&quot;.</li>
<li>Valid classes are &quot;fighter&quot;, &quot;rogue&quot;, and &quot;ranger&quot;.</li>
<li>Use the lowercase versions of these names. You're free to assume all the
user's input for class and ancestry will be lowercase, and I will only use
lowercase input for these traits when testing your code. However, if you
want your program to ignore case, then you can modify the code that reads
their input for class and ancestry by changing <code>nextLine()</code> to
<code>nextLine().toLowerCase()</code>. This will convert any capital letters in the
user input to lowercase letters. Another solution is to use
<code>.equalsIgnoreCase</code> instead of <code>.equals</code>, which will let you check for
equality while preserving the user's capitalization. If we use
<code>.equalsIgnoreCase</code> and don't convert the input to lowercase, then our
output will use the same capitalization as the user. This may or may not be
desirable; it depends on how you want the output to look.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to test your new error-checking code. You should now get an error
message if you don't enter a valid ancestry or class, but the program should
still work if you enter valid input for everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we need to update the calculations. We can break this into three phases:
adjust ability scores, calculate ability modifiers, and calculate other
values. We'll start with adjusting the ability scores. Each ancestry changes
one or more ability scores. Humans increase all of their scores by 1, elves
increase their dexterity by 2, and dwarves increase their constitution by 2.
You can structure this part as an else-if chain:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (variableName.equals(&quot;ancestry1&quot;)) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 1
} else if (variableName.equals(&quot;ancestry2&quot;)) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 2
} else if (variableName.equals(&quot;ancestry3&quot;)) {
    // TODO: adjust ability scores for ancestry 3
} else {
    // We don't need this, but it can make debugging easier. If we made a
    // mistake in our error-checking code and allowed an invalid ancestry, or
    // if we add more ancestries later and forget to update this part, then
    // we'll see this error message and know we made a mistake. This error
    // message is for us, not the user. We should only see it if our code is
    // wrong.
    println(&quot;ERROR: UNRECOGNIZED ANCESTRY! SKIPPING ADJUSTMENTS&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>After you adjust ability scores for the character's ancestry, you need to
calculate each ability's modifier. This is a separate number from the score,
and it's used in most calculations that care about the ability instead of the
raw score. The <a href="project1/../project1.html#background">Project 1 Background</a> section
explains the difference between ability scores and modifiers in more detail.</p>
<p>The SRD has a table showing the modifier for each ability score. However, we
can more easily calculate this with a short formula:
<code>abilityModifier = (abilityScore / 2) - 5</code>. The parenthesis aren't necessary,
but they emphasize the order of operations. Dividing after subtraction
(<code>(abilityScore - 10) / 2</code>) would not give us the correct modifier for some
scores below ten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="project1/part2.html#calculations">Calculations</a> section covers the remaining calculations
you need to perform. You can find the relevant formulas and other information
there. Some of these calculations change depending on the class, so you
should use an else-if chain similar to what you wrote for the ancestry
adjustments. However, make sure you declare any variables <em>before</em> the start
of the if-else chain. If you declare a variable inside an if or else body,
then that variable will only exist inside that code block, and it won't be
available later when you perform other calculations or print your output.
Here's an outline to get started:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// Declare all new variables here
int hp = 0;
// TODO: other variables

if (variableName.equals(&quot;class1&quot;)) {
    hp = /*TODO: class 1 hp calculations*/;
    // TODO: other class 1 calculations
} else if (variableName.equals(&quot;class2&quot;)) {
    // TODO: class 2 calculations
} else if (variableName.equals(&quot;class3&quot;)) {
    // TODO: class 3 calculations
} else {
    // As with the ancestry section, the extra else can help with debugging
    println(&quot;ERROR: UNRECOGNIZED CLASS! SKIPPING CALCULATIONS&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="9">
<li>Test your code. We haven't updated the output yet, but you can run the
program and check the value of each variable from the calculations section to
make sure it's what you were expecting.</li>
<li>Finally, you can adjust the output to follow the <a href="project1/part2.html#io-format">new format</a>
for 1.2 and show all of the new information you've calculated. Two of the
formatting requirements can be tricky to figure out: adding a plus to any
nonnegative modifiers and right-aligning the ability scores. You can use if
statements to handle this, but the <code>printf</code> function solves this problem
much more easily than an if statement. I won't explain <code>printf</code> here, so
read the notes if you aren't familiar with it. The formatting specifiers
you'll need are <code>%2d</code> to right-align an ability score and <code>%+d</code> to force a
plus or minus sign in front of an ability modifier.</li>

<h3 id="io-format-1"><a class="header" href="#io-format-1">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>A Guided Project program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's ancestry (String)</li>
<li>The character's class (String)</li>
<li>The character's level (int)</li>
<li>The character's ability scores
<ul>
<li>Strength (int)</li>
<li>Dexterity (int)</li>
<li>Constitution (int)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If all user input is valid, then your program must print the following output:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Player: &lt;NAME&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Character: &lt;NAME&gt;, level &lt;LEVEL&gt; &lt;ANCESTRY&gt; &lt;CLASS&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>HP: &lt;HP&gt;, AC: &lt;AC&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Ability Scores:</code></li>
<li><code>Str &lt;STRENGTH SCORE&gt; &lt;STRENGTH MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Dex &lt;DEXTERITY SCORE&gt; &lt;DEXTERITY MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Con &lt;CONSTITUTION SCORE&gt; &lt;CONSTITUTION MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Attacks:</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;ATTACK1 NAME&gt; &lt;ATTACK1 MODIFIER&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;ATTACK2 NAME&gt; &lt;ATTACK2 MODIFIER&gt;</code> (note: some characters only have one
attack)</li>
</ul>
<p>Two additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a score (strength, dexterity, and constitution) is a single-digit number,
then it must be padded with an extra space so that all scores are
right-aligned in their column.</li>
<li>Each modifier (strength, dexterity, constitution, and attack) must be preceded
by a plus or minus sign. Negative modifiers have a minus sign, and nonnegative
(which includes zero) modifiers have a plus sign. This reinforces how these
numbers are meant to be used: they are usually added to dice rolls and other
values rather than used on their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability scores and attacks should also be indented (as shown in the example
below), but this will not be checked by the tests.</p>
<p>Here is an example of possible user input and the resulting character sheet:</p>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code>Alice

Attacks:

    Longbow +5
</code></pre>
<h3 id="valid-input"><a class="header" href="#valid-input">Valid Input</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways for the user to enter invalid input:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user can enter a string or double when you were expecting an integer. If
the user entered the word &quot;nine&quot; or the number 12.4 when asked for their
level, then this would be the wrong <em>type</em> of input.</li>
<li>The user can enter the correct <em>type</em> of input, but not one of the values
they were allowed to enter. If the user entered -2 or 50 when asked for their
level, then this would be the correct type of input (an integer), but not one
of the integers they were allowed to choose for their level (a number from 1
to 20).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first kind of error is more complicated to deal with, and you probably won't
learn how to handle those errors until later in the semester. You only need to
worry about the second kind of error in this assignment. You can assume that the
user will always enter the correct type of value, but your code must check
whether it was one of the values they were allowed to choose. If the user enters
an invalid value of the correct type, then your program must print the message
<code>ERROR: INVALID INPUT</code> and exit.</p>
<p>Here are all of the rules you must enforce when checking the user's input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The level must be an integer from 1 to 20.</li>
<li>Each ability score must be an integer from 8 to 15.</li>
<li>The ancestry must be either &quot;human&quot;, &quot;elf&quot;, or &quot;dwarf&quot;.</li>
<li>The class must be either &quot;fighter&quot;, &quot;ranger&quot;, or &quot;rogue&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can assume that the user's input for class and ancestry are always
lowercase. Your code <em>must</em> correctly handle the lowercase versions of these
strings, but it doesn't matter what you do when given other capitalizations
(such as &quot;Human&quot;, &quot;RANGER&quot;, or &quot;DwARf&quot;). You can treat those as invalid and just
print an error message (easiest to code, but less user-friendly), or you can
make your code case-insensitive so that the capitalization does not matter (not
as easy, but more user-friendly). However you decide to handle the <em>input</em>, the
ancestry and class must appear as all lowercase in the program's <em>output</em>.</p>
<h3 id="calculations"><a class="header" href="#calculations">Calculations</a></h3>
<p>This program involves more calculations and variables than the previous program.
This section will serve as a reference for all values that are calculated by the
program.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before any other calculations, some of the ability <strong>scores</strong> must be
adjusted by the player's ancestry:
<ul>
<li>If the character is a human, increase each ability score by one.</li>
<li>If the character is an elf, increase their dexterity score by two.</li>
<li>If the character is a dwarf, increase their constitution score by two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each ability score has an associated number called its
<a href="https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores">modifier</a>. The modifier <em>does
not alter the score</em>, it is derived <em>from</em> the score. The srd link has a
table showing the modifier associated with each score from 1 to 30, but we
can calculate the modifier with a formula.
<ul>
<li>Each ability modifier is calculated by dividing the score by 2 and
subtracting 5. The formula should look like this:
<code>modifier = score / 2 - 5</code>.</li>
<li>It's important that you divide <em>before</em> subtracting because integer
division will round towards zero, not down. We could perform a similar
calculation by subtracting 10 and then dividing by 2, but this would give
the wrong value for odd ability scores below 10. For example, a score of 9
would produce a modifier of 0 when it should have a modifier of -1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The character's HP equals their level multiplied by the sum of their
constitution modifier and their &quot;hit die&quot;. The hit die is determined by the
character's class. A fighter has a hit die of 10, and the other two classes
have a hit die of 8. The formula should look like this:
<code>hp = level * (conModifier + hitDie)</code>.</li>
<li>The character's AC (armor class) uses a different formula depending on their
class: - A fighter's AC is equal to 18 - A ranger's AC is equal to 15 plus
their dexterity modifier, but their AC cannot be higher than 17 - A rogue's
AC is equal to 12 plus their dexterity modifier</li>
<li>The character's proficiency is not displayed, but it is used to calculate
their attack bonus. It uses the formula <code>proficiency = 1 + (level + 3) / 4</code>.</li>
<li>Depending on their class, the character has one or two attacks. Each attack
has a name and a bonus. The bonus is equal to the character's proficiency
bonus plus one of their ability modifiers.
<ul>
<li>A fighter has one attack called <code>Greatsword</code>, which uses their strength
modifier</li>
<li>A rogue has two attacks: <code>Dagger</code> and <code>Crossbow</code>, which both use their
dexterity modifier</li>
<li>A ranger has two attacks: <code>Longsword</code>, which uses their strength modifier,
and <code>Longbow</code>, which uses their dexterity modifier</li>

<li>Classes: Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, or Wizard</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The character will have six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</li>
<li>The user can choose to either roll their ability scores or use 5e's point buy
system.
<ul>
<li>Roll: the program will simulate rolling four six-sided dice for each ability
score, dropping the lowest die and summing the remaining three.</li>
<li>Point Buy: the user spends points to purchase ability scores. They can
select any score from 8 to 15 as long as they have enough points left to buy
that score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This option also requires your program to pass a set of tests, just like a
guided project. The <a href="project1/part3.html#additional-details">additional details</a> section has a list
of calculations, I/O requirements, and function requirements that will be
checked by the tests. The structure provided by these requirements may also be
helpful if you're having trouble writing this program without the usual guided
coding steps.</p>
<h4 id="option-2-custom-new-rules"><a class="header" href="#option-2-custom-new-rules">Option 2: (Custom) New Rules</a></h4>
<p>If you choose this option, then you will design a new set of character creation
rules. This doesn't have to be related to D&amp;D, and the rules don't even have to
be for a game. You could create a user account for a fictional social media app,
a profile for a professional athlete, or anything else you can think of.</p>
<p>Your new design must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your program generates additional information from the user's input. We want
our program to make creating this character (or account, profile, whatever)
more convenient for the user than if they did it by hand, so it should do a
reasonable amount of work for them. For example, the default program applies
adjustments to the character's ability scores and calculates their ability
modifiers. The user doesn't have to perform or understand these calculations
to create a character with that program.</li>
<li>Your program includes one or two &quot;advanced&quot; features that either implement
more complex rules than the formulas and error-checking from 1.2 or allow the
user to do something with their character after it's finished. Some examples:
<ul>
<li>the point-buy calculator in the default version of this project</li>
<li>a quiz that determines some of your character's stats, like you might see in
older RPGs</li>
<li>the ability to simulate skill checks, attacks, and other rolls you'd
commonly make while playing the game</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This program doesn't need to be realistic or practical. It only needs to make
sense in whatever scenario you have imagined for it. For example, the default
program doesn't come close to making a complete D&amp;D character, but it still
accurately implements most of the character creation rules it does use. You
could use a character created with that program as a starting point for a real
D&amp;D character.</p>
<p>I expect this program to be similar in complexity to the default version of the
assignment. You shouldn't need to go out of your way to make it complicated, but
don't try to use this option to trivialize the assignment. If your proposed
rules are too simple, then I will provide feedback and ask you to revise your
proposal.</p>
<p>This option exempts you from the I/O requirements, the function requirements,
and the tests for this project. It requires an approved proposal before you
start working on or submit the project.</p>
<p>Your proposal must answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain the premise of this program. What kind of character (or profile,
etc.) are we creating, and how would we use it? If it's related to something
that already exists (such as another game or intellectual property), then
feel free to link to some sources that explain it in more detail.</li>
<li>Explain the advanced feature(s) you will include in the program. Be specific
and provide enough detail for me to replicate the process by hand.</li>
<li>What information will the user provide to your program? What does this
information tell the program about the user? Include <em>all</em> information you
expect the user to provide.</li>
<li>What information will the program generate from the user's input? How will it
generate this information? Be specific and provide enough detail for me to
replicate this process by hand.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="task-2-implement-your-program"><a class="header" href="#task-2-implement-your-program">Task 2: Implement Your Program</a></h3>
<p>If you chose the default option, then refer to the
<a href="project1/part3.html#additional-details">additional details</a> section for specific requirements.</p>
<p>If you chose the custom option, then you should refer to your proposal for
specific requirements and ignore the additional details section of this
assignment.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-run-tests"><a class="header" href="#task-3-run-tests">Task 3: Run Tests</a></h3>
<p>If you chose the default version of this assignment, then your program must pass
all of the test cases for this project.</p>
<p>If you chose the custom version, then you should not attempt to test it with my
test program. Instead, you should run your program enough to be confident that
it works correctly under normal circumstances. If it is difficult for me to use
your program without encountering significant bugs or errors, then you will have
to revise and resubmit the project.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-write-up"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>After completing the program, answer the questions below in a separate document.
<strong>This is not an essay: do NOT double-space, and keep your answers to each
question separate</strong>. Your answers should be reasonably detailed and address each
question in full. I expect you to be accurate when describing your project, but
I'm otherwise not concerned with whether you provide the &quot;correct&quot; answer to a
question. Much of what I'm asking you for is your opinion or analysis of your
work. I want to know what <em>you</em> think so that I can assess your understanding
and provide useful feedback. If I disagree with you, then I will explain why and
offer suggestions without penalizing your grade.</p>
<p>Also, an important reminder: <strong>do not use ChatGPT or another LLM to assist with
or complete the write-up for you</strong>. The whole point is for you to think
critically about and explain your code. I do not care what ChatGPT &quot;thinks&quot;
about your work. Form your own opinions and justify them as best you can.</p>
<ol>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what &quot;good code&quot; means, but you should be able to justify your opinion). Explain
why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend more
time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, answer the following question if you designed your own program:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Explain how to use your program. These directions and your program's prompts
must be sufficient for someone to learn how to use your program without
reading any of the code. If your prompts are good, then you may not need to
write much for this question!</li>

<h3 id="rulescalculations"><a class="header" href="#rulescalculations">Rules/Calculations</a></h3>
<p>This section covers all of the D&amp;D rules and calculations that your program must

<h4 id="ability-scores-rolling"><a class="header" href="#ability-scores-rolling">Ability Scores: Rolling</a></h4>
<p>The user can choose to roll their ability scores. Rolling each score uses the
following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roll four six-sided dice</li>
<li>Remove the die with the lowest value (in case of a tie, only remove one die)</li>
<li>Sum the remaining three dice to determine the ability score</li>
</ul>
<p>This method produces scores between 3 and 18 (inclusive). This allows for lower
and higher scores than a player could normally get through point buy, but the
player has less control over their scores. Our program is also assigning the
scores in the order they were rolled rather than letting the player assign them.</p>
<h4 id="ability-scores-point-buy"><a class="header" href="#ability-scores-point-buy">Ability Scores: Point Buy</a></h4>
<p>The user can choose to use D&amp;D 5e's point buy system to determine their ability
scores. The point buy system has the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user has a budget of 27 points to spend on their ability scores.</li>
<li>Each ability score defaults to 8 until the user changes it.</li>
<li>The user can choose any integer from 8 to 15 (inclusive) for an ability score,
provided they have enough points remaining to purchase that score. The score
costs are as follows:</li>
</ul>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Point Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>1</td></tr>

</div>
<h4 id="ancestry-adjustments"><a class="header" href="#ancestry-adjustments">Ancestry Adjustments</a></h4>
<p>The following table shows the ability score adjustments for each ancestry.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Ancestry</th><th>Str</th><th>Dex</th><th>Con</th><th>Int</th><th>Wis</th><th>Cha</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<h4 id="ability-modifiers"><a class="header" href="#ability-modifiers">Ability Modifiers</a></h4>
<p>After adjusting a character's ability scores for their ancestry, we calculate
each ability's modifier. The score's main purpose is to determine this modifier,
whereas the modifier is the number we use for all of our calculations (hp, ac,
skills, etc.). The table below shows the modifier for each possible ability
score a character can have in this program, but you can also calculate an
ability's modifier with the formula <code>modifier = score / 2 - 5</code>.</p>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>All ability names in the AC formula and skills refer to that ability's
<em>modifier</em>, not its score. Each skill's modifier is calculated by adding the
character's proficiency bonus to the appropriate ability modifier.</p>
<p>A note about the cleric's AC: we add 15 to either the cleric's dexterity
modifier or 2, whichever is less. This limits the cleric's dexterity modifier to
+2 or less for the purpose of calculating their armor class. You can use the
<code>Math.min</code> function to take the lower of two numbers.</p>
<h4 id="hit-points"><a class="header" href="#hit-points">Hit Points</a></h4>
<p>A character's hit points can be calculated by rolling their hit die or taking an
average value for each level. A hit die is written as &quot;d&quot; followed by the number
of sides on the die. For example, &quot;d12&quot; refers to a twelve-sided die. To
calculate a character's hit points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the maximum value (the number of sides on the die) for first level,
regardless of whether you are rolling or taking the average.</li>
<li>For each level after first:
<ul>
<li>If rolling, then roll the hit die and add the character's constitution
modifier to the result</li>
<li>If taking the average, then use 1 + half the die size + the character's
constitution modifier</li>
<li>A character gains a minimum of 1 hit point per level. If the constitution
modifier is negative, then you need to make sure the result for any given
level is not less than 1. One way to do this is to use <code>Math.max</code> to take
the larger value between 1 and the number you calculated in the previous
step.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let's calculate the hit points of a 3rd level fighter with a
constitution modifier of -2. In the class table we can see that a fighter's hit
die is d10.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling (let's assume I roll a 2 and a 7 on a d10)
<ul>
<li>The fighter gains 8 hp at first level: 10 (max hit die value) plus -2 (con)</li>
<li>The fighter gains 1 hp at second level: 2 (number rolled on a d10) plus -2
(con) is less than 1, but a character must gain a minimum of 1 hp per level</li>
<li>The fighter gains 5 hp at second level: 7 (number rolled on a d10) plus -2
(con)</li>
<li>Total hp: 14</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Average
<ul>
<li>The fighter gains 8 hp at first level: 10 (max hit die value) plus -2 (con)</li>
<li>The fighter gains 4 hp at second and third level: 6 (half hit die plus one)
plus -2 (con)</li>
<li>Total hp: 16</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="io-format-2"><a class="header" href="#io-format-2">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>The I/O requirements work just like a guided project, and they will be evaluated
by the same test program. Your program should also include prompts for
information and any additional text that you think would make it easier to use.
It's up to you how much of this to include, what exactly to write, and how to
format it. The tests will not check these prompts.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>(String) player's name</li>
<li>(String) character's name</li>
<li>(String) character's ancestry</li>
<li>(String) character's class</li>
<li>(int) character's level</li>
<li>(int) either &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; to indicate whether the user wishes to (1) roll their
hit points or (2) use average hit points</li>
<li>(int) either &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; to indicate whether the user wishes to generate their
scores with (1) point buy or (2) dice roll</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user chooses point buy, then your program must accept the following
input, which will repeat until the user finishes purchasing ability scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either an ability (the three-letter abbreviation, all lowercase) or the word
&quot;done&quot;, which indicates that the user is finished with the point buy process.
If the user types &quot;done&quot;, then no more input will follow.</li>
<li>A new score for the chosen ability (int)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user enters invalid input of the correct type (for example, a level of -3
or a class of &quot;knight&quot;), then the program must print &quot;Invalid choice, try
again.&quot; and make the user re-enter that piece of input. This message and reread
must repeat until the user enters valid input. You <strong>do not</strong> have to do this
for the wrong <em>type</em> of input, such as the user entering a level of &quot;abc&quot;. That
would require exception handling, which you aren't expected to know for this
project.</p>
<p>Your program must print the following output during each iteration of the
point-buy process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current value of each ability score formatted as the ability name's
three-letter abbreviation followed by the score. There must be a space after
the ability name, and the score must be right-aligned. These should also
(optionally) be indented.</li>
<li>The current budget, formatted as &quot;Budget: X out of 27 points spent.&quot;. Replace
X with the total cost of the current set of ability scores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the point-buy output:</p>
<pre><code>Budget: 20 out of 27 points spent.
    Str 15
    Dex  8
    Con 10
    Int 11
    Wis  9
    Cha 13
</code></pre>
<p>Your program must also print a warning when the user tries to exceed their
budget when setting a score. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>You can't afford to change dex from 8 to 15.
</code></pre>
<p>Your program must print the following output when displaying the character
sheet:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Player: </code> followed by the player name</li>
<li><code>Character: ___, level ___, ___ ___</code>, replacing the blanks with the
character's name, level, ancestry (lowercase), and class (lowercase) in that
order</li>
<li><code>HP: ___, AC: ___</code>, replacing the blanks with the character's hit points and
armor class</li>
<li><code>Proficiency: +</code> followed by the character's proficiency bonus</li>
<li><code>Abilities:</code></li>
<li>Each ability's three-letter abbreviation, score, and modifier indented and
formatted as they were in the previous project</li>
<li><code>Skills:</code></li>
<li>Each skill name indented and followed by its modifier. The modifier must be
preceded by a <code>+</code> (if nonnegative) or <code>-</code> (if negative).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the character sheet output:</p>
<pre><code>Player: Alice
Character: Bob, level 15 elf bard
HP: 73, AC: 15
Proficiency: +5
Abilities:
    Str 15 (+2)
    Dex 16 (+3)
    Con 10 (+0)
    Int 12 (+1)
    Wis  9 (-1)
    Cha 13 (+1)
Skills:
    Bardic Magic +6
    Performance +6
    Persuasion +6
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you should include appropriate prompts throughout your program when
expecting user input. These prompts are ignored by the tests and should not
affect whether your program passes or fails any of them, so you can phrase these
prompts however you wish.</p>
<h3 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h3>
<p>Your <code>CharacterSheet</code> class must include all of the methods (functions)
described below. Each of these methods must have the <code>public</code> and <code>static</code>

that all of their parameters contain valid data.</p>

rules for D&amp;D 5th edition.</p>
<p>Must repeat the following process until the user is finished:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display the current ability scores and point budget.</li>
<li>Prompt the user for either an ability (the three-letter abbreviation) or the
word &quot;done&quot;, which will end the process and return the current set of ability
scores.</li>
<li>Prompt the user to enter a new score for the chosen ability. This must be an
integer between 8 and 15 (inclusive).</li>
<li>If the user has enough points left in their budget to set the chosen ability
to the chosen score, then the ability score and point budget must update.</li>
<li>If the user does not have enough points, then the program will print &quot;You
can't afford to change ABILITY from OLD to NEW.&quot; before continuing. <code>ABILITY</code>
must be replaced with the abbreviated name of the ability, <code>OLD</code> must be
replaced with the current score, and <code>NEW</code> must be replaced with the new score

<p>For this project, we will create a dice game similar to Yahtzee that can be
played on the terminal.</p>
<h2 id="background-1"><a class="header" href="#background-1">Background</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a> is a dice game played with five
six-sided dice. The game has thirteen rounds, and in each round a player may
roll their dice up to three times. After the first roll, a player can choose to
only reroll some of their dice, leaving the others the same. Once a player is
finished rolling their dice, they choose one of the thirteen scoring categories
and receive points based on their dice. Each category can only be selected once.</p>
<p>Before you begin this project, read the rules and play a few games so you
understand how it works. The
<a href="https://instructions.hasbro.com/en-ca/instruction/yahtzee-classic">official rules</a>
are available from Hasbro, and the Wikipedia article also explains how to play.

<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are required to use the methods in <code>Dice.java</code> to generate all random
numbers your program uses. This is necessary for your code to be compatible
with some of my tests. You can call any of the methods in <code>Dice.java</code> from
your <code>DiceGame.java</code> program by writing <code>Dice.methodName(args)</code>.</li>
<li><code>Dice</code> contains a <code>roll</code> method that allows you to simulate a die with any
number of sides. You can call <code>Dice.roll(6)</code> in your code to simulate a
six-sided die. <code>Dice</code> also contains methods for all of the standard polyhedral
dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20). This means you could also use
<code>Dice.d6()</code> to simulate a six-sided die. It doesn't matter whether you use the
<code>roll</code> method or one of the polyhedral dice methods.</li>
<li>This Java programs, like most of the other Java programs you will write, is
broken up into multiple methods and multiple classes. There are two ways we
will take advantage of this to make our dice game easier to code:
<ul>
<li>When writing a method that performs a complex task, we can simplify our code
by breaking the task into smaller sub-tasks and making each sub-task its own
method. We can even use these methods before we've finished writing them to
test the code for our complex task.</li>
<li>When writing a method that performs a smaller task, we can code that method
without thinking about the rest of the program as long as we've clearly
defined that methods inputs, outputs, and expected behavior. It's much
easier to think about a small task on its own than it is to think about the
entire program at once.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, this project set is meant to get you used to writing methods. My
directions will often describe methods and ask you to write them based on that
description. I will give you the code for a few of these methods, but you
should always try to write them yourself before looking at or using the
provided code. This will help you learn what these method descriptions mean so
that you're ready to write them yourself when I stop showing you what the code
looks like.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Start by creating your <code>DiceGame</code> class and giving it the standard <code>main</code>
method. The code below shows what this should look like:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">/**
 * TODO: put your name here as the author and provide a *short* description of
 * your DiceGame program.
 */
public class DiceGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Most of our code is going to go in a separate <code>game</code> method instead of in the
<code>main</code> method. It's not necessary to structure a program like this, but it
gets you used to passing a <code>Scanner</code> to different parts of your program and
makes the program a little easier for me to test. Make the following changes
to your program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import <code>java.util.Scanner</code> before you declare your <code>DiceGame</code> class.</li>
<li>Add a <code>public</code> <code>static</code> method named <code>game</code> after your main method. Give
<code>game</code> a return type of <code>void</code> and a single parameter with the type
<code>Scanner</code>.</li>
<li>In your main method, create a new Scanner that reads from <code>System.in</code>, call
<code>game</code> and pass your new scanner as the only argument, and finally close
the scanner at the end of your main method. The last step isn't strictly
necessary, but it's a good habit to close resources such as scanners when
you're done using them to avoid leaking memory.</li>
<li>In your game method, print &quot;Hello World&quot; or some other message so you can
see that the program is working when you test it. You can delete this print
statement once you know your program works.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compile and run your program after you finish making the above changes. Make
sure it compiles without errors and prints the message you put in your game
method. If you can't figure out how to make all of the above changes, here's
what your code should look like:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">/**
 * TODO: put your name here as the author and provide a *short* description of
 * your DiceGame program.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class DiceGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        game(input);

        input.close();
    }

        System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);

<p>We're going to be working with arrays during this project. As you may have
already noticed, Java does not print arrays very nicely by default. While
it's not required for this program, we can add a temporary <code>printArray</code>
method to make testing easier. Try coding <code>printArray</code> based on the following
description:</p>
<ul>
<li>a public static method that doesn't return anything.</li>
<li>has one parameter: an array of integers</li>
<li>contains a for loop that iterates over its array parameter and prints each
element of that array</li>
<li>(optional but highly recommended) uses <code>print</code> instead of <code>println</code> to keep
everything on the same line</li>
<li>(optional but highly recommended) ends with a <code>println</code> to move to the next
line</li>
<li>(optional) includes some kind of header/label before the array so we know
what we're looking at in the output</li>
<li>(optional) further decorates the output with commas to make it look nice</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need help, here's how I would write <code>printArray</code>:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">// public, static, returns nothing (void), array of ints as the only parameter (int[] a)
public static void printArray(int[] a) {
    // Print a label for the array and use print (not println) to stay on the same line
    System.out.print(&quot;Array: {&quot;);

    // Iterate over the array
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; ++i) {

        // Not important, but I want to include commas and not have an extra trailing or
        // leading comma. It looks a little nicer this way!
        if (i &gt; 0) {
            System.out.print(&quot;,&quot;);
        }

        // Print the array element with a space before it
        System.out.print(&quot; &quot; + a[i]);
    }

    // Close the curly brackets and move to the next line
    System.out.println(&quot; }&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Now we can write the <code>game</code> method. Much of our program will be handled by
three other methods, but we can write <code>game</code> first and test it with stubs
(placeholder versions) of the other methods. The game method involves several
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an array of five dice (integers).</li>
<li>Roll all of the dice in that array. We'll skip this for now because we
haven't written the method that will roll the dice for us. You should print
a placeholder message so you can see when the program reaches this step.</li>
<li>Print the dice so the user can see their initial values. For now we can do
this with <code>printArray</code>, but later we'll use a different method to convert
the dice into a string.</li>
<li>Ask the user whether they want to reroll some dice. At this point you
should be very familiar with how to prompt for and read user input.</li>
<li>If the user answers &quot;yes&quot;, then we need to ask them which dice to reroll,
reroll those dice, and print the dice again so they can see the new values.
We can skip rerolling the dice for now (another placeholder message would
be a good idea here), but we can easily prompt for input and print the dice
again. The dice won't change since we aren't rerolling anything, but we
still want the output so we can check whether our code is performing each
step when we want it to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delete the old hello world print statement and try coding this method. When
you finish, compile and run your program. Make sure you test what happens
when you answer &quot;yes&quot; and when you answer &quot;no&quot; to the reroll prompt. You
should see something similar to the sample runs below, although it doesn't
matter whether your output is exactly the same as mine. For clarity, I've put
a <code>$</code> before terminal commands and a <code>&gt;</code> before any input typed while the
program was running.</p>

</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Let's create stubs for our dice rolling methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>These methods must be named <code>rollAllDice</code> and <code>rollSomeDice</code>.</li>
<li>Both are public static methods that don't return anything.</li>
<li>Both methods have a parameter for the dice (an array of integers).</li>
<li>The <code>rollSomeDice</code> method has a second parameter: a string that contains
the &quot;label&quot; (index) of each die it has to reroll.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put a print statement inside each method so we know when we've called the
method. It should print a short message, such as &quot;You called the rollAllDice
method.&quot;</p>
<p>Compile your program again to make sure there are no syntax errors before you
continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete the placeholder print statements in your <code>game</code> method and instead
call the appropriate roll method. You should already have the necessary
parameters: the dice array for <code>rollAllDice</code>, and the dice array plus the
second piece of user input for <code>rollSomeDice</code>.</p>
<p>Compile and run your program to make sure everything works. You should expect
to see the messages from your roll methods instead of the old placeholder
messages you just deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now it's time to implement the <code>rollAllDice</code> method (remember to delete the
placeholder print statement!). This method should iterate over its parameter
(the dice array) and set each element equal to a random number from 1 to 6.
You already have two methods you can call from the <code>Dice</code> class to generate
these numbers, so choose whichever one you prefer. You also have an example
of a loop that iterates over an array in the <code>printArray</code> method.</p>
<p>Once you write this method, compile and run your program to see whether it
works. If it's working, then you should only see numbers from 1 to 6 instead
of zeroes whenever you print the array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>rollSomeDice</code> method is similar to the previous method, but we need to
reroll the dice listed in our string parameter and skip the rest of the dice.
We will assume that the string parameter is a string containing some set of
the digits 0 to 4. These represent all of the valid indexes in our dice
array. We will only reroll a die if its index appears in that string.</p>
<p>You can start by copying the code inside your <code>rollAllDice</code> method. Add an if
statement to check whether the current <strong>index</strong> (not the die value) appears
in the string parameter. You can ask a string whether it contains another
string using the <code>contains</code> method. You'll need to convert your index to a
String before calling <code>contains</code>. The method call will look something like
this (depending on your variable/parameter names):
<code>str.contains(&quot;&quot; + index)</code>.</p>
<p>Once you finish this method, go ahead and test your program again! If you
enter some numbers from 0 to 4 when asked which dice to reroll, then you
should see some of the dice values change when they're printed for the second
time. For example, responding with &quot;012&quot; should cause the program to reroll
the first three dice in the array. Remember that these rerolls are random, so
there's a chance that some of the rerolled dice will end up with the same
value as before. However, most of the dice you tell your program to reroll
should change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final step is to write a <code>diceString</code> method that will convert your dice
array to a nice-looking string. We'll show the user the labels for the dice
so they know how to specify which dice to reroll, and we'll make the output
look more like a row of dice instead of five plain numbers.</p>
<p>Start by declaring the <code>diceString</code> method: it's a public static method that
returns a <code>String</code> and takes an array of integers as its only parameter. Keep
the return type in mind: we're not printing anything inside this method body.
Instead, we're building a <code>String</code> and returning that string. The code that
calls this method will be responsible for printing the resulting string.</p>
<p>You can check the <a href="project2/part1.html#additional-details">Additional Details</a> section to see
the exact format this string must take. You can use hard-coded strings for
the labels and the top/bottom edges of the dice, but you should use a loop to
generate the middle of the dice. You can build the middle section by
concatenating each element from the dice array with the pipe character and
some spaces.</p>
<p>One last thing to remember is to add line breaks (<code>&quot;\n&quot;</code>) between the label
row, the top/bottom edges, and the middle section. This won't look very good
if everything is on the same line.</p>
<p>After you finish this method, you should be able to replace your calls to
<code>printArray</code> with <code>System.out.println(diceString(dice))</code>. As always, run your
program and make sure everything works as expected.</p>

<p>Follow the steps below and write the program as directed. Test your code
frequently, <strong>at the bare minimum performing every test given in the steps.</strong></p>
<p>If your code is not working as expected, do not move on to the next step until
you have fixed it. Moving on without finishing a step correctly will make the
problem significantly harder to fix and likely add new problems as you continue
working. If you disregard this advice, then you may get to the end of the steps
and find it would actually be less work to start over from step 1 than to debug
the code you just finished writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We'll start with a small change to our previous code. Let's replace the old
0-4 labels with letters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify the <code>diceString</code> method to use the labels A, B, C, D, and E instead
of 0-4.</li>
<li>Modify the <code>rollSomeDice</code> method to look for the letter corresponding to
each index rather than the index itself. You can convert an index to a
letter by adding it to <code>'a'</code> and converting the result to a <code>char</code>:
<code>(char)('a' + index)</code>. You can then convert this character to a <code>String</code>
and use it with the <code>contains</code> method like you did in part 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, test your program before you continue. Make sure the correct
labels are displayed and your program rerolls the proper dice when you enter
letters instead of numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're going to split our <code>game</code> method into two main parts: the reroll phase
and the score phase. Most of our current code will move to a method for the
reroll phase, and your program should still work the same as before the
split. Check that everything is working when you test it.</p>
<p>To split up the <code>game</code> method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a <code>rerollPhase</code> and a <code>scorePhase</code> method. Each of these methods
should return nothing and take two parameters: a <code>Scanner</code> and an array of
integers (our dice).</li>
<li>Move most of the code that's currently in <code>game</code> into <code>rerollPhase</code>. Leave
the lines that create the dice array and roll all of the dice in your
<code>game</code> method.</li>
<li>Call <code>rerollPhase</code> and <code>scorePhase</code> in your <code>game</code> method. The score phase
won't do anything for now, but you could add a placeholder print statement
just to show that it's getting called. Your <code>game</code> method should look
something like this:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void game(Scanner input) {
    int[] dice = new int[5];

    rollAllDice(dice);

    rerollPhase(input, dice);

    scorePhase(input, dice);
}
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Next, we will use a loop to allow the user to reroll their dice more than
once. You could also accomplish this by duplicating a lot of code, but the
loop will be shorter, cleaner, and easier to read.</p>
<p>We want to repeat the reroll process for as long as the user has rerolls
left. Make a variable to hold the number of rerolls (it should start at 2),
then create a while loop that repeats for as long as the user has more than
zero rerolls. Move the rest of your reroll phase code into this loop.</p>
<p>If the user answers &quot;yes&quot; when asked if they want to reroll their dice, then
you should decrease the number of rerolls by one. If the user does not
answer &quot;yes&quot;, then you can set the number of rerolls to zero so we don't
keep asking them to reroll their dice.</p>
<p>Finally, we can move our code that prints the user's rerolled dice out of
the loop. We're already printing the dice at the beginning of the loop, so
the user will see what changed between rerolls. We only need to print them
once after the loop so they can see the final set of dice before scoring.</p>
<p>Test your code and make sure you can reroll twice (but no more) if you
always answer &quot;yes&quot; when asked whether to reroll dice. Make sure that
answering &quot;no&quot; causes the program to print the dice once more before ending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're going to make one other change to the reroll phase so that our program
is easier to use. Currently, we have to enter two separate messages: one to
say that we want to reroll and another to say which dice we want to reroll.
As the user, it would be nice to include the dice labels when we tell the
program to reroll our dice.</p>
<p>Modify your loop so that it asks the user for a command instead of asking
whether they want to reroll. You should accept two different commands: &quot;roll
&quot; followed by some dice labels, and &quot;skip&quot;. The roll command should reroll
the dice and decrease the reroll count by one, the skip command should set
the reroll count to zero, and any other command should result in an error
message (see the <a href="project2/part2.html#io-format">I/O Format section</a>).</p>
<p>The roll command might be a little tricky to handle. However, it's much
easier once you know the right string methods (check the notes and/or Java
API for more information about these methods):</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use <code>startsWith</code> instead of <code>equals</code> to check whether the command
begins with the word &quot;roll&quot;.</li>
<li>You can get a string containing only the labels (without the word &quot;roll&quot;)
by taking a <code>substring</code> of the command. You'll need to provide the
starting index for the substring.</li>
<li>You can get the first index where a character appears in a string with the
<code>indexOf</code> method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to add a few other methods for use in the score phase:
<code>scoreString</code>, <code>calculateDiceScore</code>, and <code>countDice</code>. For now, we're just
going to write stubs (placeholders) for these methods. This will let us call
them in the score phase code before we finish writing them, much like when
we wrote the <code>game</code> method in part 1.</p>
<p>To create a stub, we just need the method signature line and, if it returns
a value, a temporary return statement in the method body. This is enough for
us to compile code that calls the method, even if the method doesn't yet do
anything useful. Write a stub for the methods listed above. Check the
<a href="project2/part2.html#functions">Functions section</a> for details like the parameters and return
type of each method. When you add the temporary return statement to these
methods, just return <code>&quot;placeholder&quot;</code> or <code>-1</code> (depending on whether the
return type is <code>String</code> or <code>int</code>). We want something that we'll easily
recognize in our output so we know that our score phase code called these
methods and used their return values.</p>
<p>As usual, compile your code and make sure it still works before you
continue!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With placeholders for our other methods, we can now write the <code>scorePhase</code>
method. We'll start with a simplified version that assumes valid input:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call <code>scoreString</code> and print the string it returns</li>
<li>Prompt the user to choose which die value they want to score</li>
<li>Subtract one from the user's input</li>
<li>Call <code>calculateDiceScore</code> with the user's chosen die value and print the
result</li>
</ul>
<p>Test your code and make sure everything still works. You should now see the
output from <code>scorePhase</code>, including the placeholder values returned by some
of the method stubs you wrote earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a loop to the prompt in <code>scorePhase</code>. If the user enters an invalid
number (valid numbers are integers from 1 to 6), then you should print an
error message and continue reading input until the user enters a valid
number.</p>
<p>Test your code and make sure it handles invalid numbers correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the <code>calculateDiceScore</code> method. You can use the <code>countDice</code> method to
count how many times the die value occurs in the dice array, then return
that number multiplied by the die value.</p>
<p>Remember that your second parameter is the <strong>category index</strong>, not the <strong>die
value</strong>. The die value will be one greater than the category index. This may
seem like an odd choice if you follow the user input from <code>scorePhase</code>
(where we subtracted one) to this method (where we added one). It will make
more sense in project 2.3 when we add the other score categories.</p>
<p>As always, test your code! We know that our <code>countDice</code> stub currently
returns -1, so we should now expect the return value to be whatever die
value we enter multiplied by -1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the <code>countDice</code> method. This method should iterate over the dice array
and count how many times the given die value appears in the array. When you
test your code, you should now see the correct score for the chosen upper
category. For example, if the user chose to score 3 with the dice 1, 6, 3,
4, and 3, then they should receive 6 points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final method we need to write is <code>scoreString</code>. To start, I recommend
creating the following array at the beginning of <code>scoreString</code>:
<code>String[] categoryNames = new String[] {&quot;Aces&quot;, &quot;Twos&quot;, &quot;Threes&quot;, &quot;Fours&quot;, &quot;Fives&quot;, &quot;Sixes&quot;};</code>.
This will give you an array with all of the category names and make it much
easier to use a loop in this method.</p>
<pre><code>Now we need to build a string. Remember, we're **not** supposed to print
anything! We need to create and return a string, then let the code that
called this method decide what to do with it. Start with the header shown
in the [I/O Format section](#io-format): `&quot;Score Options:\n&quot;`.

Finally, we can create a loop that iterates over each category index. This
loop should add a line for that category that looks like this: `    1.
</code></pre>
<p>Aces:
3<code>. We start with four spaces of indentation, then the number the     user would enter to choose this category, then the category name (from the     array we created earlier), and finally the score we would receive for that     category (use the </code>calculateDiceScore`
method).</p>
<pre><code>With this method complete, your program should be finished! Test it to make
sure everything works. The tests won't give useful feedback if you code
can't compile.

<p>A Guided Project program must meet the following I/O requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program accepts the required input in the order shown in the assignment
and does not expect any additional input.</li>
<li>The program produces each line of required output in the order specified in
the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may include additional output before, between, and after lines of
required output. This additional output must be on a separate line from any
required output.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>During each iteration of the reroll phase:
<ul>
<li>The command &quot;roll X&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; is a series of letters (uppercase or
lowercase) from A to E</li>
<li>The command &quot;skip&quot;</li>
<li>(optional) In addition to &quot;roll X&quot; and &quot;skip&quot;, you can accept abbreviations
such as &quot;r X&quot; and &quot;s&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During the score phase:
<ul>
<li>An integer</li>
<li>If the integer is not a valid choice, then read additional integers until a
valid choice is entered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program must print the following output:</p>
<ul>
<li>During each iteration of the reroll phase:
<ul>
<li>The user's dice, formatted by the <code>diceString</code> method</li>
<li>The number of rolls remaining formatted as &quot;X rolls remaining.&quot;</li>
<li>If the user enters an invalid command, the message &quot;ERROR: INVALID COMMAND&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the end of the reroll phase:
<ul>
<li>The user's dice, formatted by the <code>diceString</code> method</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During the score phase:
<ul>
<li>A list of options produced by the <code>scoreString</code> method</li>
<li>The message &quot;ERROR: INVALID NUMBER&quot; for each invalid input the user provides</li>
<li>The number of points received for the chosen category formatted as &quot;You
receive X points.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, your program should include reasonable prompts for information and
any additional text that you think would make it easier for the user to interact
with the program. It's up to you how much of this to include, what exactly to
say, and how to format it. The tests will not check these prompts.</p>

<h3 id="task-1-determine-your-rules"><a class="header" href="#task-1-determine-your-rules">Task 1: Determine Your Rules</a></h3>
<p>Choose one of the options below.</p>
<h4 id="option-1-default-yahtzee"><a class="header" href="#option-1-default-yahtzee">Option 1: (Default) Yahtzee</a></h4>
<p>If you choose this option, then you must complete the program by implementing
the remaining parts of Yahtzee. Your program must follow all of the standard
rules except for the &quot;Yahtzee Bonus&quot; rules in the official rules. In your
program, a Yahtzee should be treated like any other scoring category with no
special cases.</p>
<p>Program summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single user will play a full thirteen rounds of Yahtzee.</li>
<li>Each round will consist of a reroll phase and a score phase.
<ul>
<li>During the reroll phase the user can reroll their dice up to two times, and
they can choose which dice to reroll each time.</li>
<li>During the score phase the user must choose one unused score category to
determine how many points they receive for their dice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After thirteen rounds, the game will end and the user will see a final
scorecard showing their points in each category, as well as their total score.</li>
</ul>
<p>This option also requires your program to pass a set of tests, just like a
guided project. The <a href="project2/part3.html#additional-details">additional details</a> section has a list
of calculations, I/O requirements, and function requirements that will be
checked by the tests. The structure provided by these requirements may also be
helpful if you're having trouble writing this program without the usual guided
coding steps.</p>
<h4 id="option-2-custom-other-dice-game"><a class="header" href="#option-2-custom-other-dice-game">Option 2: (Custom) Other Dice Game</a></h4>
<p>If you choose this option, then you can implement a different dice game instead
of finishing Yahtzee. This can be a game you designed or an existing game. I
expect the game you implement to be similar in complexity to Yahtzee. A simple
game that takes little effort to code is not appropriate for this project. Feel
free to ask me about your game before submitting a proposal if you're not sure
whether I will allow you to use it.</p>
<p>This option exempts you from the I/O requirements, the function requirements,
and the tests for this project. It requires an approved proposal before you
start working on or submit the project.</p>
<p>Your proposal must answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain the rules of your game in enough detail that I or another person
could play your game using real dice. If you are using an existing game, then
you can summarize the rules (in your own words), state any changes you are
making to the rules, and link to the official rules or another source that
explains them in detail. I expect you to play your game a few times to ensure
you understand the rules and that any rules you changed or designed yourself
work in practice.</li>
<li>Explain how the user would interact with your program. Describe any commands
or input the user would be expected to type while using the program and how
the program should respond.</li>
<li>Describe three new functions you expect to create while implementing this
program. What do these functions do, what parameters do they require, and
what (if anything) do they return? These must be new functions that did not
already exist in 2.1 or 2.2, not modified versions of functions you wrote for
those programs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your answers to questions 2 and 3 may change as you write your program, and
that's okay! As long as your game's rules remain the same, you do not need to
submit a new proposal. You will address changes to the functions and user input
in the writeup task.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-implement-your-program-1"><a class="header" href="#task-2-implement-your-program-1">Task 2: Implement Your Program</a></h3>
<p>If you chose the default option, then refer to the
<a href="project2/part3.html#additional-details">additional details</a> section for specific requirements.</p>
<p>If you chose the custom option, then you should refer to your proposal for
specific requirements and ignore the additional details section of this
assignment.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-run-tests-1"><a class="header" href="#task-3-run-tests-1">Task 3: Run Tests</a></h3>
<p>If you chose the default version of this assignment, then your program must pass
all of the test cases for this project.</p>
<p>If you chose the custom version, then you should not attempt to test it with my
test program. Instead, you should run your program enough to be confident that
it works correctly under normal circumstances. If it is difficult for me to use
your program without encountering significant bugs or errors, then you will have
to revise and resubmit the project.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-write-up-1"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up-1">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>After completing the program, answer the questions below in a separate document.
<strong>This is not an essay: do NOT double-space, and keep your answers to each
question separate</strong>. Your answers should be reasonably detailed and address each
question in full. I expect you to be accurate when describing your project, but
I'm otherwise not concerned with whether you provide the &quot;correct&quot; answer to a
question. Much of what I'm asking you for is your opinion or analysis of your
work. I want to know what <em>you</em> think so that I can assess your understanding
and provide useful feedback. If I disagree with you, then I will explain why and
offer suggestions without penalizing your grade.</p>
<p>Also, an important reminder: <strong>do not use ChatGPT or another LLM to assist with
or complete the write-up for you</strong>. The whole point is for you to think
critically about and explain your code. I do not care what ChatGPT &quot;thinks&quot;
about your work. Form your own opinions and justify them as best you can.</p>
<ol>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what &quot;good code&quot; means, but you should be able to justify your opinion). Explain
why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend more
time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, answer the following questions if you designed your own program:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Explain how to use your program. You can assume the user has read the rules
of your dice game, but don't assume they know anything about how to use your
program yet. These directions and your program's prompts must be sufficient
for someone to learn how to use your program without reading any of the code.
If your prompts are good, then you may not need to write much for this
question!</li>
<li>What changes, if any, did you make to the user input you described in your
proposal? Why did you make these changes?</li>
<li>What changes, if any, did you make to the functions you described in your
proposal? Why did you make these changes?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deliverables-5"><a class="header" href="#deliverables-5">Deliverables</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>All Java code you wrote for this assignment
<ul>
<li>If you went with the default version, then this is a single file named
<code>DiceGame.java</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your writeup</li>

<h2 id="additional-details-5"><a class="header" href="#additional-details-5">Additional Details</a></h2>
<p>This section covers the requirements for anyone who chose the default option. If
you went with the custom option, then you can ignore this part of the
assignment.</p>
<p>A note about category numbers: you may notice that the user's input and the
output we display to the user always labels the score categories from one to
thirteen, but in our code we use the numbers zero to twelve. The numbers one to
thirteen will feel more natural to the average user, but these numbers are all
off by one if we need to index an array. Remember to subtract one when going
from user input to an array index and add one to an array index before
displaying it to the user.</p>
<h3 id="io-format-5"><a class="header" href="#io-format-5">I/O Format</a></h3>
<p>The I/O requirements work just like a guided project, and they will be evaluated
by the same test program. Your program should also include prompts for
information and any additional text that you think would make it easier to use.
It's up to you how much of this to include, what exactly to write, and how to
format it. The tests will not check these prompts.</p>
<p>Your program must accept the following user input:</p>
<ul>
<li>During each iteration of the reroll phase:
<ul>
<li>The command &quot;roll X&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; is a series of letters (uppercase or
lowercase) from A to E</li>
<li>The command &quot;skip&quot;</li>
<li>(optional) In addition to &quot;roll X&quot; and &quot;skip&quot;, you can accept abbreviations
such as &quot;r X&quot; and &quot;s&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During the score phase:
<ul>
<li>An integer</li>
<li>If the integer is not a valid choice, then read additional integers until a
valid choice is entered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program must print the following output:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of each round:
<ul>
<li>The round number, formatted as &quot;Round X&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During each iteration of the reroll phase:
<ul>
<li>The user's dice, formatted by the <code>diceString</code> method</li>
<li>The number of rolls remaining formatted as &quot;X rolls remaining.&quot;</li>
<li>If the user enters an invalid command, the message &quot;ERROR: INVALID COMMAND&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the end of the reroll phase:
<ul>
<li>The user's dice, formatted by the <code>diceString</code> method</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During the score phase:
<ul>
<li>The output of the <code>scoreString</code> function</li>
<li>The message &quot;ERROR: INVALID CATEGORY&quot; for each input the user provides that
isn't a number from 1 to 13</li>
<li>The message &quot;ERROR: CATEGORY UNAVAILABLE&quot; for each input the user provides
that corresponds to a category that was already taken</li>
<li>The number of points received for the chosen category and that category's
name formatted as &quot;You receive X points for Y.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the final round:
<ul>
<li>The line &quot;Final Score Card:&quot;</li>
<li>The output of the <code>scoreString</code> function</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functions-2"><a class="header" href="#functions-2">Functions</a></h3>
<p>Your <code>DiceGame</code> class must include all of the methods (functions) described
below. Each of these methods must have the <code>public</code> and <code>static</code> modifiers.</p>
<p>Unless told to handle specific errors, you should assume that all of your
parameters contain valid values.</p>
<h4 id="game-2"><a class="header" href="#game-2"><code>game</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>void</code></li>
<li>Parameters:
<ul>
<li>A <code>Scanner</code> for reading user input</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Must perform the following process for each round of the game (total of 13):</p>
<ul>
<li>Print the round number</li>
<li>Roll five dice</li>
<li>Call <code>rerollPhase</code>, passing the scanner and dice as arguments</li>
<li>Call <code>scorePhase</code>, passing the scanner, dice and other data as arguments</li>
</ul>
<p>Must print the final score card after the last round ends.</p>
<p>You should create three additional arrays at the start of this method: the
category names (<code>String[]</code>), scores (<code>int[]</code>), and categories used (<code>boolean[]</code>)</p>
<h4 id="rollalldice-2"><a class="header" href="#rollalldice-2"><code>rollAllDice</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>void</code></li>
<li>Parameters:
<ul>
<li>An <code>int</code> array representing a set of five dice</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each element of the array parameter must be set to a random number from 1 to 6.</p>
<p>To ensure compatibility with my tests, there are a few additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each random number is generated by either the <code>roll</code> method or the <code>d6</code> method
of the <code>Dice</code> class.</li>
<li>Your program &quot;rolls&quot; the dice in the order they appear in the array.</li>
<li>Your program does not roll extra dice. For example, calling one of the Dice
class's methods to generate a random number when you don't need to reroll a
die, or rolling each die twice instead of once.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rollsomedice-2"><a class="header" href="#rollsomedice-2"><code>rollSomeDice</code></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Return type: <code>void</code></li>
<li>Parameters:
<ul>
<li>An <code>int</code> array representing a set of five dice</li>
<li>A <code>String</code> containing letters from a to e, representing the labels of all
dice that will be rerolled</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each element of the array parameter whose label appears in the string parameter
must be set to a random number from 1 to 6. Each element of the array parameter
whose label does <strong>not</strong> appear in the string parameter should be left as is.</p>
<p>Labels are not case-sensitive. An element's label is determined by its index:</p>
<ul>
<li>index 0 -&gt; a</li>
<li>index 1 -&gt; b</li>
<li>index 2 -&gt; c</li>
<li>index 3 -&gt; d</li>
<li>index 4 -&gt; e</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure compatibility with my tests, there are a few additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each random number is generated by either the <code>roll</code> method or the <code>d6</code> method
of the <code>Dice</code> class.</li>
<li>Your program &quot;rolls&quot; the dice in the order they appear in the array.</li>
<li>Your program does not roll extra dice. For example, calling one of the Dice
class's methods to generate a random number when you don't need to reroll a
die, or rolling each die twice instead of once.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may assume that the letters in the label string are all lowercase, sorted
alphabetically, and that no letter appears more than once. For example, your
program will never be given the label string &quot;adc&quot; or &quot;aacd&quot;, but it may be
given the label string &quot;acd&quot;.</p>

<p>The returned string must be formatted as shown below. Each <code>X</code> must be replaced
with an element from the array parameter, and these elements must appear in
order.</p>

<li>Prompt the user for and read a command</li>
<li>Execute the user's command:
<ul>
<li>roll: the string of letters after &quot;roll &quot; must be passed to the
<code>rollSomeDice</code> method along with the dice array, and the roll count should
be decreased by one</li>
<li>skip: the roll count should be set to zero</li>
<li>Any other commands must result in an error message</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Display the user's dice again after the above loop is finished.</p>

<h3 id="task-1-design-and-research"><a class="header" href="#task-1-design-and-research">Task 1: Design and Research</a></h3>
<h4 id="pick-an-idea"><a class="header" href="#pick-an-idea">Pick an Idea</a></h4>
<p>First, you need to decide what kind of program to write. This can be <em>anything</em>,
so choose an idea that you find interesting and will enjoy creating.</p>
<p>Many students struggle to generate ideas when starting this project. If you're
not sure what to do, then I recommend beginning with a list of your hobbies and
interests. Consider how programming can be combined with one of those topics or
what kind of program you might find useful when engaging with that
hobby/interest. <strong>Do not ask me to suggest a topic for you.</strong> I'm happy to
discuss ideas that you're considering or discuss how you might apply your
programming skills to a particular topic, but you need to come up with ideas and
choose one that's appealing to you.</p>
<p>This project is meant to challenge you, so I expect the proposed program to be
similar in scope and complexity to projects 1.3 or 2.3. I will not approve your
proposal if the program appears too small to be a challenge, and I will be
reluctant to approve any projects that I don't think can reasonably be finished
in several weeks.</p>
<h4 id="pick-a-research-topic"><a class="header" href="#pick-a-research-topic">Pick a Research Topic</a></h4>
<p>Second, choose and research a topic that will help you create this program. I
want you to spend some time learning about a feature of the Java programming
language or a part of the standard library that we haven't covered in class. You
could also choose something we have covered in class and explore it in more
depth.</p>
<p>Don't choose an arbitrary topic. Look for something relevant to your project
that will make it easier to create your program or improve the program. Consider
what features you want to include in your program and what you'll need to learn
to implement those features.</p>
<p>You might already have a topic that really interests you. If you're more
motivated to learn about multi-threading, for example, than you are to write a
particular program, then it's fine to start with a research topic that you
really like and make up an idea for a program that will let you use your
research topic.</p>
<h4 id="research"><a class="header" href="#research">Research</a></h4>
<p>You might want to discuss the topic with me before you start on the research. I
can't pre-approve your proposal, but I can tell you whether I think the program
and topic are appropriate.</p>
<p>Research can include looking up tutorials, reading a textbook, reading
documentation, or just experimenting on your own. I'm not expecting a
bibliography. All I want you to do is choose a programming topic and learn about
it.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-proposal"><a class="header" href="#task-2-proposal">Task 2: Proposal</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a proposal describing your project. Your proposal should be
approved before you begin working on the program, and you cannot submit a
project until the week after your proposal was submitted.</p>
<p>A proposal must include the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Summarize the program you intend to write. Tell me enough about the program
that I'll understand what it does and why someone might want to use it.</li>
<li>Why is this project interesting to you and what made you want to work on it?</li>
<li>Tell me about the topic you researched for this project and how you expect to
use it in your program.
<ul>
<li>What is the topic?</li>
<li>What did you know about the topic before starting this project?</li>
<li>What have you learned about the topic from your research?</li>
<li>How will it be used to write your program?</li>
<li>Include a <em>short</em> example program demonstrating how you expect to make use
of this topic in your project. This should be Java code that can compile
and run. If this kind of example is not appropriate for your topic, then
provide a more appropriate example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>List all of your deliverables for this project. This means everything I
should expect you to send me when you submit the finished project. At a
minimum, this will include all of your source code and a writeup.</li>
<li>Describe the project's essential features in detail. You must clearly explain
each feature and what I should expect to see when I run the program. You must
include enough information for me to determine whether you've implemented the
features correctly in your finished program. <em>I will use this section to
determine whether your project is complete, and I will not approve a proposal
that doesn't include enough information for me to evaluate your program.</em></li>
<li>Describe any additional features that you want to implement but don't
consider essential to the project. I will not hold you to these when
evaluating your program, and you don't even need to include this part in your
proposal. It's here so you have a place to further describe what you want to
do but can't commit to doing, and to remind you that not every idea needs to
make it into the finished program.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will aim to give feedback on all proposals within one week of their
submission. Remember that you may also need to revise your proposal before I
approve it, so you should submit the proposal at least a week before you plan to
start working on the program. If you wait until near the end of the semester,
then you might not be able to get a proposal approved in time to also submit the
project.</p>
<h4 id="proposal-revisions"><a class="header" href="#proposal-revisions">Proposal Revisions</a></h4>
<p>You're free to submit a revised proposal at any time. I will review and either
approve it or ask for changes just like your initial proposal.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-program"><a class="header" href="#task-3-program">Task 3: Program</a></h3>
<p>If your proposal has been approved, then you can go ahead and write your
program. It must include the essential features described in your proposal and
make use of your research topic as described in your proposal.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-write-up-2"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up-2">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a document (preferably a PDF) with your program that contains
the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instructions for using the program. These must be accurate and include
sufficient detail for someone unfamiliar with your program to use all of its
features. You do not need to explain how to compile it unless it involves
more than running <code>javac</code> on the source code (for example, if the user must
import a third-party library or install other software).</li>
<li>A description of how your research topic was used in the program. Include and
explain at least one example from your project's source code.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what &quot;good code&quot; means, but you should be able to justify your opinion). Explain
why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend more
time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deliverables-6"><a class="header" href="#deliverables-6">Deliverables</a></h2>
<p>This is covered by your proposal.</p>
<h2 id="group-projects"><a class="header" href="#group-projects">Group Projects</a></h2>
<p>If you would like to work on this project with one or more other students, then
you can submit a group proposal. I will expect significantly more out of group
projects. Below is a list of changes to the project requirements.</p>
<h3 id="group-proposal"><a class="header" href="#group-proposal">Group Proposal</a></h3>
<p>If you are submitting a group proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each group member must choose their own different research topic (and research
it) before you write your proposal.</li>
<li>Each group member must write their own separate answers to questions two and
three. The group proposal must include each member's answers to these
questions.</li>
<li>Each essential feature for question five must designate one group member as
the person primarily responsible for implementing that feature. You aren't
committed to dividing up the work this way, but I want you to put some thought
into how the work will be divided before you begin the project.</li>
<li>A group project must be somewhat greater in scope and complexity than projects
1.3 and 2.3.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-work"><a class="header" href="#group-work">Group Work</a></h3>
<p>When you are working on the program, your group must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that each member contributes a comparable amount of work to the other
members. Each person's contributions will differ, but they must account for a
significant portion of the project. It's not okay for most of the work to fall
on one person or for one person to contribute far less than everyone else.</li>
<li>Keep track of each individual member's significant contributions to the
project.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is a shared responsibility</strong>, and it requires regular communication
within your group. If you cannot communicate with your group members enough to
divide work fairly and keep track of individual contributions, then you cannot
work as a group on this project.</p>
<p>I also do not care whether you're the one leaving most of the work to the rest
of your group, the one doing twice as much work as everyone else, or a bystander
watching this imbalance take place. All of these are unacceptable. If you decide
to work as a group, then you are accepting some responsibility for your group
members. Don't work with people who you don't trust to be good group members,
and don't remain with a group if you feel the other members are not meeting
their obligations to the rest of the group.</p>
<h3 id="group-write-up"><a class="header" href="#group-write-up">Group Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a group write-up that covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question one (the instructions) from the original write-up</li>
<li>The record of individual contributions mentioned earlier</li>
</ul>
<p>Each group member must submit their own individual write-up that covers the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remaining questions from the original write-up</li>
<li>A summary of their contributions to the group</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-submission"><a class="header" href="#group-submission">Group Submission</a></h3>
<p>I only need one submission with the group write-up and all other deliverables
listed in your proposal. The individual write-ups can be submitted by each group
member separately or included with the group submission.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="testing"><a class="header" href="#testing">Testing</a></h1>
<p>All guided projects (and the default versions of expanded projects) are checked
by the same test program. This chapter covers how to use the test program and
how to interpret the test results.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-test-program"><a class="header" href="#the-test-program">The Test Program</a></h1>
<p>This section explains what the program is and includes some details that you
don't need in order to use it. This information is here in case you're curious
about how the program works, and it may help you troubleshoot any problems that
come up when using it.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>The test program is written in Java and launched by a shell script called
<code>test.sh</code>. This script runs <code>tests/bin/projecttests/Main</code> and passes along any
arguments you provide (everything you type after <code>sh tests/test.sh</code>).</p>
<p>I've only tested this program on bash terminals. It should work fine on <code>bash</code>,
<code>zsh</code>, or a <code>bash</code> emulator running on Windows. You might be able to run it from
<code>cmd</code> or <code>powershell</code> by using the same command found in <code>test.sh</code>, but I don't
know whether every part of the program will work correctly.</p>
<h2 id="tests-directory"><a class="header" href="#tests-directory">Tests Directory</a></h2>
<p>Below is a view of the <code>projects</code> directory, the <code>tests</code> directory, and their
contents (assuming you set up the project folders and unpacked the test program
correctly):</p>
<pre><code>projects/
├── project1/
├── project2/
└── tests/
    ├── bin/
    ├── logs/
    ├── res/
    ├── src/
    ├── student/
    ├── build
    ├── LICENSE.txt
    ├── README.txt
    └── test.sh
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>logs</code> and <code>student</code> directories are not included in the zip, but the
program will create them when it runs.</p>
<p>You should never need to edit anything in the <code>tests</code> directory or any of its
subdirectories. <strong>The test program may overwrite any files inside of the <code>tests</code>
directory or its subdirectories, so don't keep any of your own files in there!</strong>
Here is a summary of the files and directories inside of <code>tests</code> and their
purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bin</code> contains the compiled Java code (<strong>binary</strong> files such as .class and
.jar files) for the test programs</li>
<li><code>res</code> contains <strong>resources</strong> used by the tests, such as inputs, expected
outputs, and supplementary jshell scripts</li>
<li><code>logs</code> contains logs generated by the test program</li>
<li><code>src</code> contains the Java <strong>source</strong> code for the tests</li>
<li><code>student</code> contains modified copies and compiled versions of your code used by
the tests, backup copies so the status command can check for changes, and a
record of the last test for each project</li>
<li><code>build</code> is the bash script that I use to compile the test program</li>
<li><code>LICENSE.txt</code> is the text of the MIT license, which applies to this test
program</li>
<li><code>README.txt</code> is a text file containing some of the documentation provided here</li>
<li><code>test.sh</code> is the aforementioned shell script that launches the test program</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as you know not to use the <code>tests</code> directory for your own documents, you
don't need to be familiar with anything inside that folder to use the program.</p>
<h2 id="test-logs"><a class="header" href="#test-logs">Test Logs</a></h2>
<p>When the test program runs, it will write information about what it's doing to a
log file. This file isn't usually going to be helpful unless you need me to
troubleshoot an unusual problem or if I need to fix a bug in my test code. Log
files are saved to the <code>tests/logs</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="backup-copy-of-student-code"><a class="header" href="#backup-copy-of-student-code">Backup Copy of Student Code</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the program saves a backup copy of your code so that the
status command can check whether your program has changed since it was last
tested. While I'm calling this a &quot;backup copy,&quot; you should not rely on it to
back up your work for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the most recently-tested version of your project is saved, and the backup
file(s) are overwritten every time you run the test command with that project.</li>
<li>The <code>tests</code> folder is in the same location as your project folders, which
means a mishap that causes you to lose your projects will probably delete the
tests folder and any backup copies it contains.</li>
<li>If you start editing this file, then your work will be lost (probably with no
way to recover it) as soon as you run the test command with that project. This
is why I cautioned you earlier not to keep any of your own files inside of the
<code>tests</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep your work backed up separately with a cloud storage service such as
Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. If you know how to use version control
software such as git, then keep your work backed up in a remote repository. If
you lose work that was saved when testing your program, then it won't hurt to
check whether the backup copy includes some of the lost work, but don't count on
it. That's not why it's there, and I don't want it to give you a false sense of
security.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="download"><a class="header" href="#download">Download</a></h1>
<p>Download the latest version of the tests below or from our shared OneDrive
folder. If you are experiencing an error with the test program, then you should
make sure you have the most recent version before reporting the error to me. You
can check which version you are running with the <code>version</code> command. The older
versions are archived here as well just in case there's an unexpected issue with
the latest version or someone needs to check an older version for some reason.</p>
<p>Latest version:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="testing/../archives/tests_0_6_0.zip">tests_0_6_0.zip</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Previous versions (fall 2024):</p>
<ul>
<li>none</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="anti-virus-false-positives"><a class="header" href="#anti-virus-false-positives">Anti-Virus False Positives</a></h2>
<p>Some anti-virus programs may flag the test zip as malware and quarantine it.
This is a false positive, and you will need to look up how to tell your
anti-virus program not to block or quarantine the test program download.</p>
<h2 id="unpackingupdating"><a class="header" href="#unpackingupdating">Unpacking/Updating</a></h2>
<p>You only need to unpack the program when you first download it or when you
download a new version. To unpack the program:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the downloaded zip archive in your <code>projects</code> folder.</li>
<li>Open your terminal and navigate to your <code>projects</code> folder.</li>
<li>Run the command <code>unzip tests_VERSION.zip</code> (replace VERSION with whatever
version number appears in the zip folder name) to unpack the test files into
your <code>projects/tests</code> folder. For example, if the test zip is named
<code>tests_0_6_0.zip</code>, then you would unzip it by running
<code>unzip tests_0_6_0.zip</code>.</li>
<li>If you already have a tests folder from a previous version, then the unzip
command will ask you about each duplicate file to make sure you want to
replace them. You can choose 'All' to say yes to every file without having to
go through the prompts. You can also include the <code>-o</code> flag after the unzip
command (<code>unzip -o tests_VERSION.zip</code>) if you want it to overwrite files
without prompting you.</li>
<li>You don't need the zip folder after you've extracted the contents. I
recommend deleting it so you don't clutter your projects folder with old
versions of the test program.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="testing-guide"><a class="header" href="#testing-guide">Testing Guide</a></h1>
<p>This section is a walkthrough covering how to test and submit your guided
projects. Make sure you've downloaded and unpacked the test program as directed
in the <a href="testing/./download.html">download section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="usage-summary"><a class="header" href="#usage-summary">Usage Summary</a></h2>
<p>You should always run this program from your projects directory (where you have
your project1, project2, and tests folders) by entering
<code>sh tests/test.sh &lt;command&gt;</code> on the terminal. Replace <code>&lt;command&gt;</code> with one of
the commands described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>help</code> prints a help message for the program or a specific command.</li>
<li><code>version</code> prints the program's version.</li>
<li><code>status</code> checks the current status of each of your projects: whether the
expected files/folders were found, whether you've previously tested that
project, and whether it is currently passing the tests.</li>
<li><code>test</code> runs the tests for one or more projects.</li>
<li><code>pack</code> zips the files for every guided project that has passed its tests to
prepare them for upload to Blackboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you can view the help text by running <code>sh tests/test.sh help</code>.</p>
<p>When running this program, make sure you read any error messages it shows you.
I've tried to include error messages that cover common problems you may
encounter. I expect you to try following any directions in the error messages
and using the help command before asking me why something isn't working.</p>
<h2 id="1-status-check"><a class="header" href="#1-status-check">1. Status Check</a></h2>
<p>Before testing a project, you should use the status command to determine which
projects can be found and whether they were previously recorded passing or
failing their tests. The status command's output looks like this (as of version
0.6.0):</p>
<pre><code>Project 1.1

Required project files:
    (FILE FOUND) project1/part1/CharacterSheet1.jsh

Last recorded test:
    No record found

Project 1.2

Required project files:
    (FILE FOUND) project1/part2/CharacterSheet2.jsh

Last recorded test:
    Result: PASS
    Tested: 2024-05-05T13:37:37.717462504
    Modified since last test: NO

Project 1.3

Required project files:
    (FILE MISSING) project1/part3/CharacterSheet.java

Last recorded test:
    No record found

Project 2.1

Required project files:
    (FILE FOUND) project2/part1/DiceGame.java

Last recorded test:
    Result: PASS
    Tested: 2024-05-07T18:22:19.252365889
    Modified since last test: NO

Project 2.2

Required project files:
    (FILE FOUND) project2/part2/DiceGame.java

Last recorded test:
    Result: PASS
    Tested: 2024-05-07T18:22:19.252365889
    Modified since last test: YES

Project 2.3

Required project files:
    (FILE MISSING) project2/part3/DiceGame.java

Last recorded test:
    No record found

</code></pre>
<p>To further explain this output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required project files: this lists each file that should exist for the project
and where it should be located inside your projects folder. If will also say
whether the file was found, is missing, or was found but miscapitalized. If
your file was not found or was miscapitalized, then you may have named a file
or folder incorrectly.</li>
<li>Last recorded test: as of version 0.6.0, the test program will save the
overall result of each test and a backup copy of your code in the
<code>tests/student</code> folder. If the status command can find those files, then it
will show the following information:
<ul>
<li>Result: whether the last test passed or failed.</li>
<li>Tested: the date and time on which the last test was completed.</li>
<li>Modified since last test: whether there is a difference between your current
code and the backup copy saved during the last test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your project's required files were all found, then you should be able to test
that project. If the required files were found, the last test passed, and the
files haven't been modified since that last test, then you should be ready to
submit that project on Blackboard (using the pack command to zip everything
first).</p>
<h2 id="2-testing-a-project"><a class="header" href="#2-testing-a-project">2. Testing a Project</a></h2>
<p>To test a project, run the test command followed by the number of the project
you want to test (1.1, 1.2, etc.). You can also run the test command with no
project numbers to test all projects that can be found and either haven't been
tested or have been modified since their last test. For example,
<code>sh tests/test.sh test 1.1</code> would run the tests for project 1.1, whereas
<code>sh tests/test.sh test</code> would attempt to test every project that appears ready
for and in need of testing.</p>
<p>If you entered a valid project number, the program will attempt to run all of
the tests for that project with your code. This may take a minute or two. After
it's finished, you should see a message informing you that the test is complete.
You can now check the test results with the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>summary</code> displays a summary of the entire set of tests. If your program
passed every test case, then the overall result should say <code>PASS</code>. If any
tests failed, timed out, or unexpectedly crashed, then the overall result
should say <code>FAIL</code>.
<ul>
<li>If a test timed out, then your program may have an error that causes it to
run for an extended period of time (such as an infinite loop). You should
run your program manually to make sure this isn't the issue.</li>
<li>If a test crashed, then there was an unexpected error while the test was
running. This could be a bug in the test program, and I recommend rerunning
the test to see if it happens again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>list</code> lists a summary of each individual test case: the test case's id
number, whether that test case passed or failed, and how many lines of the
expected output matched your output</li>
<li><code>code</code> shows your code used in the test case</li>
<li><code>show</code> displays information about a specific test case. You can specify what
information to show, or let the command print everything it has for that test
case. A test case can contain a lot of information, so you may need to scroll
up to see all of it.</li>
<li><code>help</code> provides information about the commands you can run while browsing test
results.</li>
<li><code>quit</code> stops browsing the test results and moves on to the next project (if
you're testing multiple projects) or exits the test program. The details of
these test results are not saved, so you won't be able to view them again
without rerunning the test.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interpreting-test-results"><a class="header" href="#interpreting-test-results">Interpreting Test Results</a></h3>
<p>A failed test case can contain several useful pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The input shows what input was provided to your code. This may include two
categories of input:
<ul>
<li><strong>Program Input</strong> shows what the user typed on the terminal. You can
replicate this part of the test input by running your code and typing
exactly what you see in this section or using I/O redirection.</li>
<li><strong>Function Parameters (Before)</strong> shows what values were passed to your
function when it was called. This is not applicable to jshell scripts, but
compiled Java programs will always be tested by calling one of their
functions. You can replicate this part of the input by calling the function
being tested and passing identical values as arguments. The <strong>(Before)</strong>
means that this is what the parameters looked like before your code ran.
Some parameters may be mutable objects (such as arrays), which makes it
possible for your code to modify them. If your code modifies mutable
parameters unnecessarily, then it will not pass the test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The student output shows the result of running your code. There are three
possible categories included in the output:
<ul>
<li><strong>Program Output</strong> shows what the program printed when running.</li>
<li><strong>Function Parameters (After)</strong> shows what the function parameters looked
like after running your code. This only applies to compiled Java tests, and
it will only matter when the parameters include mutable objects such as
arrays.</li>
<li><strong>Function Return Value</strong> shows what the function returned at the end of the
test. This only applies to compiled Java programs, and it will only show up
when testing a function with a return type other than <code>void</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The expected output shows the expected results of running code that meets all
of the project's requirements. It will include the same categories as the
student output. If any of these don't match your output, then the test case
will fail.</li>
<li>The errors section shows errors that occurred while the test case was running.</li>
<li>The additional feedback section may contain more information about the test
case or hints about common mistakes that would cause this test case to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you're looking at the output sections, you'll see each line labelled as
&quot;MATCH&quot;, &quot;NO MATCH&quot;, or &quot;ERROR&quot;. These labels are there to help you find the
mistakes in your program's output that caused it to fail this test case.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MATCH</code> means this line was found in both your output and the expected output.
Every line in the expected output must match for the test to pass.</li>
<li><code>NO MATCH</code> means this line of output didn't match the expected output and will
therefore be ignored when determining whether the test passed. This is used
for your program's output that doesn't match the expected output because your
code is allowed to print extra output.</li>
<li><code>ERROR</code> means this line of the output didn't match and caused the test to
fail. This is used for all function-related output (parameters after and
return value), as well as the expected program output. All of this output must
match exactly for your code to pass the test case.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-packing-and-submitting-a-project"><a class="header" href="#3-packing-and-submitting-a-project">3. Packing and Submitting a Project</a></h2>
<p>After a project passes its tests, you need to put all of your project files in a
single zip folder before uploading them to Blackboard. You can do this manually,
or you can use the test program's <code>pack</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="with-pack-command"><a class="header" href="#with-pack-command">With <code>pack</code> Command</a></h3>
<p>Run the test program with the <code>pack</code> command to copy the files for every project
that has passed its tests into a zip file. You can then upload this zip to
Blackboard. <strong>Warning</strong>: remember to check the contents of the zip before
uploading it and make sure it contains everything you were expecting. My program
most likely packed everything correctly, but it's always possible that it made a
mistake due to a bug.</p>
<h3 id="manually-create-zip"><a class="header" href="#manually-create-zip">Manually Create Zip</a></h3>
<p>If you want to create the zip folder manually, then you need to check that all
of your files and folders are named correctly. The <code>status</code> command should take
care of this, and it will also let you know whether that project was previously
recorded passing its tests. You should be able to select all of your project
folders, right-click, and then compress or create a new zip folder (the exact
command will depend on your operating system).</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>zip</code> command on the terminal. You'll need to specify the
full path to each file this way. For example, the command to zip projects 1.1
and 1.2 would look like this:
<code>zip guided_project_submission.zip project1/part1/CharacterSheet1.jsh project1/part2/CharacterSheet2.jsh</code>.
The <code>zip</code> utility is not included with Git Bash, so it probably won't be
available on Windows.</p>
<p>Be aware that if files or folders are misnamed (either incorrect spelling or
incorrect capitalization), then the scripts I use to process submissions will
not handle your files correctly and I will not mark them as complete. This is
why the test program includes the <code>pack</code> and <code>status</code> commands: to check that
everything is ready to submit and zip it correctly. If you don't want to use
them, then you need to take care to name and package the files exactly as
required before submitting them. Don't create the zip manually to avoid fixing a
problem the <code>pack</code> or <code>status</code> command warned you about.</p>
