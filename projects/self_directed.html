<p>A Self-Directed Project is a completely open-ended assignment. You will design a
program that you would like to build in Java, submit a proposal for approval,
and then create your program.</p>

<h2 id="tasks"><a class="header" href="#tasks">Tasks</a></h2>
<h3 id="task-1-design-and-research"><a class="header" href="#task-1-design-and-research">Task 1: Design and Research</a></h3>
<h4 id="pick-an-idea"><a class="header" href="#pick-an-idea">Pick an Idea</a></h4>
<p>First, you need to decide what kind of program to write. This can be <em>anything</em>,
so choose an idea that you find interesting and will enjoy creating.</p>
<p>Many students struggle to generate ideas when starting this project. If you're
not sure what to do, then I recommend beginning with a list of your hobbies and
interests. Consider how programming can be combined with one of those topics or
what kind of program you might find useful when engaging with that
hobby/interest. <strong>Do not ask me to suggest a topic for you.</strong> I'm happy to
discuss ideas that you're considering or discuss how you might apply your
programming skills to a particular topic, but you need to come up with ideas and
choose one that's appealing to you.</p>
<p>This project is meant to challenge you, so I expect the proposed program to be
similar in scope and complexity to projects 1.3 or 2.3. I will not approve your
proposal if the program appears too small to be a challenge, and I will be
reluctant to approve any projects that I don't think can reasonably be finished
in several weeks.</p>
<h4 id="pick-a-research-topic"><a class="header" href="#pick-a-research-topic">Pick a Research Topic</a></h4>
<p>Second, choose and research a topic that will help you create this program. I
want you to spend some time learning about a feature of the Java programming
language or a part of the standard library that we haven't covered in class. You
could also choose something we have covered in class and explore it in more
depth.</p>
<p>Don't choose an arbitrary topic. Look for something relevant to your project
that will make it easier to create your program or improve the program. Consider
what features you want to include in your program and what you'll need to learn
to implement those features.</p>
<p>You might already have a topic that really interests you. If you're more
motivated to learn about multi-threading, for example, than you are to write a
particular program, then it's fine to start with a research topic that you
really like and make up an idea for a program that will let you use your
research topic.</p>
<h4 id="research"><a class="header" href="#research">Research</a></h4>
<p>You might want to discuss the topic with me before you start on the research. I
can't pre-approve your proposal, but I can tell you whether I think the program
and topic are appropriate.</p>
<p>Research can include looking up tutorials, reading a textbook, reading
documentation, or just experimenting on your own. I'm not expecting a
bibliography. All I want you to do is choose a programming topic and learn about
it.</p>
<h3 id="task-2-proposal"><a class="header" href="#task-2-proposal">Task 2: Proposal</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a proposal describing your project. Your proposal should be
approved before you begin working on the program, and you cannot submit a
project until the week after your proposal was submitted.</p>
<p>A proposal must include the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Summarize the program you intend to write. Tell me enough about the program
that I'll understand what it does and why someone might want to use it.</li>
<li>Why is this project interesting to you and what made you want to work on it?</li>
<li>Tell me about the topic you researched for this project and how you expect to
use it in your program.
<ul>
<li>What is the topic?</li>
<li>What did you know about the topic before starting this project?</li>
<li>What have you learned about the topic from your research?</li>
<li>How will it be used to write your program?</li>
<li>Include a <em>short</em> example program demonstrating how you expect to make use
of this topic in your project. This should be Java code that can compile
and run. If this kind of example is not appropriate for your topic, then
provide a more appropriate example.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>List all of your deliverables for this project. This means everything I
should expect you to send me when you submit the finished project. At a
minimum, this will include all of your source code and a writeup.</li>
<li>Describe the project's essential features in detail. You must clearly explain
each feature and what I should expect to see when I run the program. You must
include enough information for me to determine whether you've implemented the
features correctly in your finished program. <em>I will use this section to
determine whether your project is complete, and I will not approve a proposal
that doesn't include enough information for me to evaluate your program.</em></li>
<li>Describe any additional features that you want to implement but don't
consider essential to the project. I will not hold you to these when
evaluating your program, and you don't even need to include this part in your
proposal. It's here so you have a place to further describe what you want to
do but can't commit to doing, and to remind you that not every idea needs to
make it into the finished program.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will aim to give feedback on all proposals within one week of their
submission. Remember that you may also need to revise your proposal before I
approve it, so you should submit the proposal at least a week before you plan to
start working on the program. If you wait until near the end of the semester,
then you might not be able to get a proposal approved in time to also submit the
project.</p>
<h4 id="proposal-revisions"><a class="header" href="#proposal-revisions">Proposal Revisions</a></h4>
<p>You're free to submit a revised proposal at any time. I will review and either
approve it or ask for changes just like your initial proposal.</p>
<h3 id="task-3-program"><a class="header" href="#task-3-program">Task 3: Program</a></h3>
<p>If your proposal has been approved, then you can go ahead and write your
program. It must include the essential features described in your proposal and
make use of your research topic as described in your proposal.</p>
<h3 id="task-4-write-up"><a class="header" href="#task-4-write-up">Task 4: Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a document (preferably a PDF) with your program that contains
the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instructions for using the program. These must be accurate and include
sufficient detail for someone unfamiliar with your program to use all of its
features. You do not need to explain how to compile it unless it involves
more than running <code>javac</code> on the source code (for example, if the user must
import a third-party library or install other software).</li>
<li>A description of how your research topic was used in the program. Include and
explain at least one example from your project's source code.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that was either challenging to
write or that you think is an example of particularly good code (it's up to you
what &quot;good code&quot; means, but you should be able to justify your opinion). Explain
why you chose this code: why is it an example of good code or what was
challenging about writing it? Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
<li>Review your program and find a piece of code that you think could be improved.
What do you dislike or want to change about this code? If you were to spend more
time on the project, how might you improve this code? To be clear, I'm not
asking you how the <em>program</em> could be better. I don't want to know what feature
you'd add or how you'd make it easier to use. I'm asking how part of the <em>code</em>
could be better. This might mean shorter, easier to read, less repetitive, or
something else that you value and think you could improve with additional time
and/or programming knowledge. Include the code in your answer and note the line
number(s) where it appears in your program.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deliverables"><a class="header" href="#deliverables">Deliverables</a></h2>
<p>This is covered by your proposal.</p>
<h2 id="group-projects"><a class="header" href="#group-projects">Group Projects</a></h2>
<p>If you would like to work on this project with one or more other students, then
you can submit a group proposal. I will expect significantly more out of group
projects. Below is a list of changes to the project requirements.</p>
<h3 id="group-proposal"><a class="header" href="#group-proposal">Group Proposal</a></h3>
<p>If you are submitting a group proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each group member must choose their own different research topic (and research
it) before you write your proposal.</li>
<li>Each group member must write their own separate answers to questions two and
three. The group proposal must include each member's answers to these
questions.</li>
<li>Each essential feature for question five must designate one group member as
the person primarily responsible for implementing that feature. You aren't
committed to dividing up the work this way, but I want you to put some thought
into how the work will be divided before you begin the project.</li>
<li>A group project must be somewhat greater in scope and complexity than projects
1.3 and 2.3.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-work"><a class="header" href="#group-work">Group Work</a></h3>
<p>When you are working on the program, your group must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that each member contributes a comparable amount of work to the other
members. Each person's contributions will differ, but they must account for a
significant portion of the project. It's not okay for most of the work to fall
on one person or for one person to contribute far less than everyone else.</li>
<li>Keep track of each individual member's significant contributions to the
project.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is a shared responsibility</strong>, and it requires regular communication
within your group. If you cannot communicate with your group members enough to
divide work fairly and keep track of individual contributions, then you cannot
work as a group on this project.</p>
<p>I also do not care whether you're the one leaving most of the work to the rest
of your group, the one doing twice as much work as everyone else, or a bystander
watching this imbalance take place. All of these are unacceptable. If you decide
to work as a group, then you are accepting some responsibility for your group
members. Don't work with people who you don't trust to be good group members,
and don't remain with a group if you feel the other members are not meeting
their obligations to the rest of the group.</p>
<h3 id="group-write-up"><a class="header" href="#group-write-up">Group Write-Up</a></h3>
<p>You must submit a group write-up that covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Question one (the instructions) from the original write-up</li>
<li>The record of individual contributions mentioned earlier</li>
</ul>
<p>Each group member must submit their own individual write-up that covers the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remaining questions from the original write-up</li>
<li>A summary of their contributions to the group</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-submission"><a class="header" href="#group-submission">Group Submission</a></h3>
<p>I only need one submission with the group write-up and all other deliverables
listed in your proposal. The individual write-ups can be submitted by each group
member separately or included with the group submission.</p>
